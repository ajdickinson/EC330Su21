# The rise of "big data"

---
# Theoretical social science

Until very recently, social scientist were very limited by data to study these types of .hi[policy questions]

Social science has been mostly a .hii[theoretical field] to make policy recommendations

--

- Develop mathematical models (economics)
- Qualitative theories (sociology)

--

.hi[Problem:] We were never able to test most of these theories
- Led to politicalization of scientific questions such as

&gt; Is Obamacare reducing job growth in America?


---
# Big data and empirics

Thanks to growing availability of data, social science is becoming more empirical
- Test and improve theories using real world data

# "Big data" and the American Dream


---
# The American Dream

 The .hi[American Dream] has been defined as .blue[the aspiration that children] should have .blue[higher standards of living] than their parents
 
--

.center[.hi[Is the American Dream alive and well today?] .hii[How should we judge that?]]

--

How can we measure the American Dream? What is a good .hi[statistic?]

 
--

Obama (2014): 
    
&gt; People's frustrations are partly rooted "in the fear that their kids won't be better off than they were."

--

.hi[One way to measure the American Dream:]
- What fraction of children earn more income than their parents? 

--

.center[.hii[How has this statistic changed over time]]

---
# Measuring the American Dream

.hi[Central policy question:] Why are children's chances of climbing the income ladder falling in America?
- What can we do to reverse this trend?

--

Difficult to answer using .hi[historical data] and .hii[macroeconomic trends]

--

.hi[Problem:] We have too few data points to test all alternative explanations

--

- We never had the data to link parental income across generations

--

Now, economists are able to observe .hi[tax records] over time; linking generational income

- Chetty et al. (2017)

--

Using .hi[big data], we can now observe generational differences in income

.hi[Two] major changes in the American economy since the 1940s:

.hii[(i).] Lower total economic growth

.hii[(ii).] Less equal distribution of growth

# Growth in family income

--

.hi[What policies can increase absolute mobility?]

--

Consider two hypothetical scenarios for children born in 1980:

.hii[(i).] .hi[Higher growth]

&gt; 1940 cohort growth rate with the 1980 cohort historical distribution

.hii[(ii).] .hi[More broadly shared growth]

&gt; Same 1980 cohort historical growth rates but 1940 cohort distribution across income groups

---
# Restoring the American Dream

.hi[Main lesson:] Restoring the American Dream of high rates of upward mobility will require .hii[more broadly shared] economic growth

- Need policies that will increase incomes throughout the distribution

--

.hi[Two approaches of redistribution]

.hii[(i).] .hi[Redistribution]

  - Piketty and Saez: Reduction in top income taxes and erosion of unions and min wage have led working-class Americans to fall behind

--

.hii[(ii).] .hi[Human Capital Investment]

  - Goldin and Katz: race between education and technology – need education to keep pace with technological change to increase wage rates

# Human Capital Investment

Education is not just about technical skills; social skills matter a lot too

.hi[Implication:] Policies to improve such skills could range from changes in education and training to housing voucher policies

--

.hi[So far] we have assumed that restoring the American dream is desirable. Is it?

--

 _Should the growth be shared equally?_
 
 - e.g: Should we try to focus on policies that restore the fading American Dream?


---
# The American Dream

.qa[Q]: How does increasing equality of opportunity impact economic growth?

--

  - Difficult to measure effects on growth directly

--

.hi[Solution:] Focus on a key channel that many economists believe is the primary driver of growth 

--

.center[.hi[innovation]]

---
# Innovation

.center[
![](./figures/innov.png)
]

---

# Another Question

.qa[Q] Why would patent rates vary with parental income?

--

.hi[(i).] .hi[Ability]: Children from high-income families have a greater ability to innovate

--

.hi[(ii).] .hi[Preferences]: Lower-income children prefer less risky occupations

--

.hi[(iii).].hi[Constraints]: Lower-income children have comparable talent and preferences but lack resources and or exposure

.center[

---
# Innovation vs Math scores

Not much of the gap is explained by ability

--

.hi[It seems you need three things things:]

- High quantitative ability

- Rich parents

- Exposure to other innovators

--

Much of the gap is explained by _neighborhood effects_: e.g. what seems to matter for innovation is who you grow up around. 

---
# Map

.center[
![](./figures/innov2.png)

---
# Neighborhood effects

.qa[Q]: How do we know that it truly is neighborhood effects (e.g who you grow up near) not driving this, and .hi[not] just ability sorting?

--

  - Chetty et al. isolate the causal impacts of neighborhoods by analyzing the propensity to patent by a narrow technology class
  
&lt;br&gt;

.hi[Intuition:] Genetic ability (sorting of high skilled labor) is unlikely to vary significantly across similar technology classes. 


---

# Causal Effect of Neighborhoods


---
# Causal Effect of Neighborhoods

The last topic brought rise to a bigger question: 

--

.center[.hi[How would we think about figuring out the impact of where a child grows up on various outcomes for the child later in life?]]

--

We have two very different explanations: 

--

.hii[(i).] .hi[Sorting:] Similar people live near each other (educated people live near other educated people)

--

.hii[(ii).] .hi[Causal impacts]: places have a .hi[causal effect] on updward mobility

---
# Causal Effect of Neighborhoods

What is the ideal (without godlike powers) experiment?

--

Randomly assign children to neighborhoods and compare outcomes in adulthood
- Can't do this? So what can we do?
  
--

.hi[(Chetty &amp; Hendren (2018))]

.hi[Quasi-experiment:] Use data on 3 million families that move across census tracts. 
 
.hi[Key Idea] Exploit variation in _age of child_ when family moves to identify causal impact of neighborhood environment

# Assumptions

To identify causal impact of neighborhoods, you need to believe that .hi[the timing of moves to better/worse areas are unrelated to other determinants of child's outcomes].

--

This assumption might now hold for two reasons:

--

.hi[(i).] Parents who move to good areas when their children are young might be different than those who move later

--

.hi[(ii).] Moving may be unrelated to other factors (e.g change in parents' job) that impact children directly

--

Both of these concerns are addressed

- Compare across siblings

- Placebo tests

# A Familiar Map

![](./figures/chetty_map.png)


---

# Last Q

OK, so: .hi[neighborhoods matter for upward mobility]. Next question: _why does this vary across cities/places?_

- To answer this question, it would be good to start by comparing places with high upward mobility to low upward mobility
  
  - Do places with higher mobility have better schools, jobs, institutions, something else? All?

# Correlations

![](./figures/nbhds_4.png)

# Correlations

5 strongest correlates of upward mobility are:

.hii[(ii).] .hi[Income Inequality:] Places with a smaller middle class have less mobility

--

.hii[(iii).] .hi[School Quality:] Higher expenditure, smaller classes, higher test scores `\(\implies\)` more mobility
  
--

.hii[(iv).] .hi[Family Structure:] Areas with more single parents have much lower mobility
  - Strong correlation even for kids whose _own_ parents are married
  
--
  
.hii[(v).] .hi[Social Capital:] "Takes a village to raise a child"

# Policies to improve upward mobility

In general, there are two policy approaches to increasing upward mobility

--

.hii[(i).] .hi[Moving to Opportunity] (MTO): Provides affordable housing in high-opportunity areas

--

.hii[(ii).] .hi[Place-Based Investments]: Increases upward mobility in low-opportunity areas

--

.qa[Q]: Can you think of the pros and cons of each approach?

---
# MTO

.hi[MTO Experiment:]

Implemented from 1994-1998 in 5 locations: Baltimore, Boston, Chicago, LA, NY
- 4,600 families randomly assigned to one of three groups:

--

.hii[(i).] .hi[Experimental]: Offered housing couchers restricted to low-poverty census tracts
  
--

.hii[(ii).] .hi[Section 8]: Offered conventional housing vouchers, no restrictions
  
--

.hii[(iii).] .hi[Control]: not offered a voucher, stayed in public housing

---

# Results

.center[
![](./figures/nbhds_5.png)
]

---
# Implications

Housing vouchers can be effective -- but should be target carefully

- Vouchers should be explicitly designed to help families move to affordable, high-opportunity areas

--

  - In MTO experiment, unrestricted vouchers produced .hi[smaller] gains even though families could have made same moves
 
--

  - More generally, low-income families rarely use cash transfers to move to better neighborhoods

--

  - 80% of 2.1 Section 8 vouchers are currently used in high-poverty, low-opportunity neighborhoods

---


# MTO Issues

What are the concerns with experiments like MTO?

--

.hii[(i).] .hi[Costs]: how costly would it be to scale this up?

--

.hii[(ii).] .hi[Negative spillovers]: does integration hurt the wealthy (which would dampen the effect of the spillovers)?

--

.hii[(iii).] .hi[Limits to scaling due to sorting]. If you move all low-income people into a high-income neighborhood, it is no longer a high-income neighborhood. 

---

# Place-Based Approaches

A .hi[place-based approach] would be something like:

.hii[(i).] Investment in schools in high-poverty areas

--

.hii[(ii).] Investment in infrastructure in high-poverty areas

--

.qa[Q]: What is the main problem with place-based approaches?

--

  - Displacement! Locational eq `\(\implies\)` more people sort into a neighborhood if it has higher school quality
  
--

  - This drives up prices and the residents that it intended to help were ultimately harmed

We have finished all of the material in the class!

__Thank you__ for your time and energy. A quick recap:

1) Big, philosophical questions
  
  - What is a city? Why do they exist?
  
  - What makes some cities grow and others shrink?

2) Tools!

  - Locational equilibrium (x2)
  
  - Bid-rent curves
  
  - Two labor market models
  
---
# This course: In Review

3) Applications:

  - Min wage &amp; rent control
  
  - Land use &amp; housing policy
  
  - Transportation

--

My .hi[big picture] takeaways:

  - Location matters! The geographic level at which we implement policy matters, too
  
  - Differences in structure of labor/housing market can lead to vastly different outcomes from the same policy
  
  - Public policy questions are often more nuanced than they appear on a surface level

# The Bid-Rent Curve

A .hi-slate[Bid - Rent Curve:] The relationship between rental prices and the distance of land from the city center <sup>.pink[†]</sup>

.footnote[
.pink[†] It actually does not have to be the city center -- can be a point of attraction. In this class we will always use the city center though.
]

.hi-slate[These curves vary across sectors:]

--

- .hi-orange[Housing:] Accessibility to employment (low commuting costs)

--

- .hi-orange[Industrial Space:] Accessibility to consumers and suppliers

--

- .hi-orange[Tech/Office Space:] Accessibility to information

# Agricultural land rent model

.ul[.hi-slate[Definitions:]]

- .hi-pink[Land rent:] Periodic payment by a land consumer to a landowner

- .hi-pink[Market value:] The amount paid to become the landowner

--

.ul[.hi-slate[Setup:]]

Rent on a plot of land is determined by how productive the plot is

--

  - .slate[Agriculture:] Price of plot is determined by fertility
  
--

.hi-pink[Consider a setting] where farmers grow corn on two types of land 
.pull-left[
  - High fertility (HF): Produces 4 units of corn]
.pull-right[
  - Low fertility (LF): Produces 2 unites of corn]
  
---

# Agricultural land rent model

.hi-pink[Assumptions:]
<nobr>
.pull-left[
- Farmers rent from landowners
- no barriers to the corn market
- $TC = 15$ (excluding rent) 
]
.pull-right[
- Perfect competition
- $P_{corn} = 10$
]

--

.center[.hi-slate[How much will farmers bid for land?]]

--

.pull-left[
.hi-pink[Revenue:] $TR = P_{corn} \cdot Q_{corn}$
- HF: $TR_{HF} = 10 \cdot 4 = 40$
- LF: $TR_{LF} = 10 \cdot 2 = 20$
]

--

.pull-right[
.hi-pink[Profit:] $\Pi = TR - TC$
- $\Pi_{HF} = TR_{HF} - TC = 40 - 15 - r$
- $\Pi_{LF} = TR_{LF} - TC = 20 - 15 - r$
]

--

.center[.hi-slate[Recall] .hi-pink[A05: Competition drives economic profit to zero]]

---

The following table computes maximum WTP for rent:

![](./figures/table01.png)

Since there are no barriers to entry, more firms will enter

- $\Pi \rightarrow 0$

--

- $\Pi_{HF} = TR_{HF} - TC = 40 - 15 - r = 0 \Rightarrow r = 15$
- $\Pi_{LF} = TR_{LF} - TC = 20 - 15 - r =  \Rightarrow r = 5$

# (i) Housing prices model

Extend the bid-rent model to the housing sector within a city

--

.hi-slate[Assumptions:]

(i). Commuting costs are the .hi-pink[only] location factor in decision making

--

(ii). Only .hi-pink[one member] of household commutes to employment area

--

(iii). They only considers the .hi-pink[monetary] cost of commuting (no time cost)

--

(iv). Noncommuting travel is .hi-pink[insignificant]

--

(v). Public services, taxes, amenities are the same everywhere 
  
  - implied by (i)
  
--

.hi-slate[Assumptions ensure the employment area is the focal point of the city]

---





# Locational Indifference

.hi[Axiom 1]: _Housing prices adjusts until there is locational indifference_ (and prices in general)

  - IE: A marginal increase in rent just offsets the lower commuting costs
  
--

.hi.orange[In math]:

\begin{align*}
\Delta P \cdot h + \Delta x \cdot t = 0
\end{align*}


.pull-left[

- $P$: .hi-slate[Price] of housing (per $ft^2$)

- $h$: .hi-slate[Housing quantity] ( $ft^2$ )

]

.pull-right[

- $x$: .hi-slate[Distance] of commute (miles)

- $t$: .hi-slate[Commuting costs] (per mile)

]


---

# Slope of the Housing Bid-Rent Curve 


If there is locational indifference we can derive the .hi.purple[slope] of the .hi[bid-rent] curve:

\begin{align*}
\underbrace{\Delta P \cdot h}_{\text{Marginal change in housing cost}} + \underbrace{\Delta x \cdot t}_{\text{Marginal change in commuting cost}} &= 0
\end{align*}


---


# Slope of the Housing Bid-Rent Curve 


If there is locational indifference we can derive the .hi.purple[slope] of the .hi[bid-rent] curve:

\begin{align*}
\Delta P \cdot h + \Delta x \cdot t &= 0\\
\Delta P \cdot h &= -\Delta x \cdot t
\end{align*}


---


# Slope of the Housing Bid-Rent Curve 


If there is locational indifference we can derive the .hi.purple[slope] of the .hi[bid-rent] curve:

\begin{align*}
\Delta P \cdot h + \Delta x \cdot t &= 0\\
\Delta P \cdot h &= -\Delta x \cdot t\\
\frac{\Delta P}{\Delta x} &= -\frac{t}{h}
\end{align*}


--

.hi.slate[Notice]: $\frac{\Delta P}{\Delta x}$ is the .purple[slope] of the .pink[bid-rent] curve

--

  - price is on the verticle axis, distance is on the horizontal. So this is rise over run

--

--

$\Delta P \cdot h  = -\Delta x \cdot t$: Another way of putting this: $MC = MB$! 


---



# Another Derivation

Suppose you have decided that the optimal amount of money to spend on housing and commuting per month is $M^*$

- You can allocate this as

\begin{align*}
P\cdot h + x \cdot  t = M^*
\end{align*}


- Since we graph the bid rent curve in the $(x,P)$ space, we solve for $P$:

--

\begin{align*}
P\cdot h + x \cdot  t &= M^*\\
P\cdot h &= M^* - x\cdot t
\end{align*}


--



---




# Another Derivation

Suppose you have decided that the optimal amount of money to spend on housing and commuting per month is $M^*$

- You can allocate this as

\begin{align*}
P\cdot h + x \cdot  t = M^*
\end{align*}


- Since we graph the bid rent curve in the $(x,P)$ space, we solve for $P$:



\begin{align*}
P\cdot h + x \cdot  t &= M^*\\
P\cdot h &= M^* - x\cdot t\\
P &= \frac{M^*}{h} - \frac{t}{h} \cdot x
\end{align*}

--

- Slope: $\Delta P = 0 - \frac{t}{h} \cdot \Delta x \implies \frac{\Delta P}{\Delta x} = -\frac{t}{h}$
  
  - Can also take derivative if p w.r.t x and get the same thing, if that is easier for you


--



---


# No Substitution

.hi.slate[Example] Suppose the following:

--

  - Each household has $800 a month to spend on housing and commuting

--

  - All rental units are the same size, with each HH occupying a rental unit that is 1000 sq ft
  
--

  - Monthly commuting cost is $50 dollars per mile from employment center

--

--

.qa[Task]: Draw the housing - price curve. Put miles from city center on .hi.orange[x axis] and price per square foot on .hi[y axis]


---




# Example: The housing price curve

```{R, bid_rent_nosub, echo=F,fig.height = 4, fig.width = 7, dev = "svg", cache=T}

bid_rent <- function(x) .8 - .5*x

ggplot(data.frame(x=c(0, 10)), aes(x)) + 
  stat_function(fun= bid_rent, col = "purple")+
  xlim(0,1.6)+
  ylim(-.2,1)+
  geom_vline(xintercept =0, size = 0.5) +
  geom_hline(yintercept =0, size = 0.5)+
  ggthemes::theme_pander(base_family = "LM Roman 10")+
  labs(x = "10s of miles from city center", y = "Price of housing (per square foot)")+
  geom_text(x =0, y= .8, label = "a", hjust=2)+
  geom_text(x=1.6, y =0, label = "b",vjust= 2)

```

__a__: max WTP for a square foot (at center of city) (80 c per square foot)

__b__: furthest away from center HH is willing to live (16 miles)

---



# Substitution

.qa[Q1]: If you really wanted to live closer to campus -- or an exciting downtown in a big city -- would you be willing to live in a smaller apartment to do so?


--

.qa[A1]: Most people<sup>`r emo::ji("tm")` </sup>: Yes. You are willing to .pink[substitute]

--

.qa[Q2]: What do I mean by .pink[substitute]? Substitute what?

--

.qa[A2]: Substitute housing consumption for .purple[lower commuting cost] (and whatever else being close to the center of the city gets you)

  

--

---


# Substitution

Let's formalize the mechanism for substitution a bit:

--

 .pink[higher prices] $\implies$ .purple[higher oppurtunity cost] per square foot of housing (for the consumer)

--

--

- As price of rent increases, consumers are likely to substitute (atleast somewhat) towards other goods, decreasing the square footage of housing demanded

--

- __Housing units closer to city centers are thus likely to be smaller in size__

--



---


# Adding substitution to the model




.qa[Q3]: Did our model of locational indifference accomdate for substitution? Why or Why not?

\begin{align*}
\Delta P \cdot h + \Delta x \cdot t &= 0
\end{align*}

--

.qa[A3]: No because $h$ (the quantity of housing consumed) is .hi[independent of distance] from center, $x$ 

--


.purple[_If consumers can substitute_], our locational indifference condition becomes:

--

\begin{align*}
\Delta P \cdot h(x)  + \Delta x \cdot t = 0 
\end{align*}

--

- Where $h(x)$ is an _increasing_ function of x 

--

  - .hi.slate[Ex]: $h(10) > h(5)$ (the quantity of housing demanded 10 miles from the center exceeds that of 5 miles)

# Manufacturing Bid Rent

WTP for land from manufacturing firms is a function of the land's accessibility (similar to consumers)

- .hi.purple[Fact]: Urban manufacturing employment is largely decentralized and disperesed
  
  - Most firms locate close to the highway. .hi[Why]? This has not always been the case
  

  
--

- Firms are balancing .hi[freight] and .hi.purple[labor costs]
  
  - Further from labor $\implies$ .purple[higher wage] (to compensate for increased commuting cost)
  
  - Further from shipping center $\implies$ higher .pink[freight cost]

--

---

# Manufacturing Bid Rent

Let's start with a simple model<sup>`r emo::ji("tm")` </sup> . .hi.slate[Assumptions]


--

1) Input & Output .hi[prices] & .hi.purple[quantities] are fixed

--

  - Firm only decides location
  
--

2) Firms .pink[import intermediate goods] and .purple[export output] to other cities via a .hi[central terminal] (train)

--

3) Wage paid is to compensate workers for commuting. Workforce is suburban so wage is .pink[highest at center]

--

4) Firms use horse carts to transport inputs and output to the .hi[central terminal]

  - We will relax this one soon


--

# Firm's Bid Rent

What do we use to get the firm's bid - rent equation?

__Axiom 5__: _.pink[Competition generates zero economic profit]_

--

Recall the profit equation:

\begin{align*}
\pi = TR - TC
\end{align*}


--

In this model:


--

- $TR = P*Q$ (fixed, exogenous)

--

- $TC$ is a function of .pink[freight cost, labor cost, and intermediate goods cost]:

\begin{align*}
TC(x) = \text{Freight Cost}(x)+ \text{Labor Cost}(x) + \text{Land Cost}(x)+\\
\text{Intermediate Input Cost}
\end{align*}

--

--

---


# Firm Bid Rent

From here on out, let's call $\text{Intermediate Input Cost} = \bar{I}$


- Invoking zero economic profit, from the last slide we can write:

--

\begin{align*}
TR - (\text{Freight Cost}(x)+ \text{Labor Cost}(x) +\text{Land Cost}(x) +\bar{I} ) = 0
\end{align*}

--

--

- .hi.slate[In words]: .pink[The most a firm would be willing to pay for land then is revenue net of non land cost]. Rearranging:

--

\begin{align*}
\text{Land Cost}(x) = TR - \text{Freight Cost}(x) - \text{Labor Cost}(x) - \bar{I}
\end{align*}

--

.hi.slate[Note]: Land Cost = $P(x)*L_m$, where:


- $P(x)$ is the _.purple[price of land at x miles away from the center]_

- $L_m$ is the _.pink[amount of land the manufacturer uses in production]_ (fixed input at $L_m$)

---


# Firm Bid Rent: Equation

We can replace land cost with $P(x)* L_m$ to get the equation for the .hi[manufacturing bid rent] curve

--

\begin{align*}
P(x)*L_m = TR - \text{Freight Cost}(x) - \text{Labor Cost}(x) - \bar{I}
\end{align*}

--


---




# Firm Bid Rent: Equation

We can replace land cost with $P(x)* L_m$ to get the equation for the .hi[manufacturing bid rent] curve


\begin{align*}
P(x)*L_m &= TR - \text{Freight Cost}(x) - \text{Labor Cost}(x) - \bar{I}\\
P(x) &= \frac{TR - \text{Freight Cost}(x) - \text{Labor Cost}(x) - \bar{I}}{L_m}
\end{align*}

.hi.slate[In words], this equation says:

--

- Higher revenues $\implies$ higher land prices .pink[for every distance] $x$

- An increase in freight costs, labor costs, or intermediate input costs will __decrease__ the price for every distance $x$


--



---

# Example

Suppose 

$P = 5$, $Q = 2$, $FC(x) = 4x$, $\texttt{Labor}(x) = 1-3x$, $L_m =1$, $\bar{I} = 0$

1) Derive the firm's bid rent curve. Carefully write down your steps

2) What is the price the firm is willing to pay for land at $x = 1$?

3) Is the WTP higher or lower when we move away from the center?

4) What distance away from the center is the WTP zero?

---


# Example

1) Start with zero profit: 
$\pi(x) = 0 \implies TR - FC(x) - LC(x) - P(x) = 0$
Plugging in:
\begin{align*}
5\times 2 - 4x-(1-3x)-P(x) &= 0\\
9 - x &=P(x) 
\end{align*}

2) $P(1) = 8$

3) Lower (if $x_2 > x_1$, $P(x_2) < P(x_1)$)

4) $P(x)=0 \implies x= 9$

# Back to Reality

How can a model like this help us understand the industrial revolution?

  - What happened to freight costs? .hi[They fell] A few innovations:

--

__Transportation Innovations__:

  - Omnibus (1827)
  
  - Cable Cars (1873)
  
  - Electric Trolley (1886)
  
  - Subways (1895)

--

In our model, what do these innovations do? __Decrease labor costs relative to freight__

---

- Truck decreased the cost of moving .hi.purple[output] .mono[relative] to the cost of moving .hi.purple[workers]

- Manufacturing Firms moved closer to low-wage suburbs

# Office Space

Last bid - rent curve we will work on: that for .hi[offices]

.hi.slate[Assumptions]

--

- Office firms use high skilled labor that need _face to face_ interaction for production

--

- Proximity to other office firms is an important input

--

- Oppurtunity cost of high skilled labor time is greater than other types of labor

--

---


# Office Bid Rent

- So as office firms get further from center their "transit" cost goes up. So what must happen to WTP? 

--

```{R, office_plot, echo=F,fig.height = 5, fig.width = 8, dev = "svg", cache=T}



office <- function(x)  20 / (1+x)

ggplot(data.frame(x=c(0, 20)), aes(x)) +

# City Organization

So how do we put all of this together? And why are these called __bid__ rent curves anyways? 

--

- .hi[Land will be allocated to highest bidder]

- This will vary by location in the city

--

.hi.slate[Example]

- Assume profit for office and manufacturing is given by

--

- $\pi_{\text{office}} = 105 - r(x_{\text{Office}}) - (5 + 4\times x_{\text{office}})$

- $\pi_{\text{manufact}}=  75 - r(x_{\text{manufact}}) - (5 + 2\times x_{\text{manufact}})$

--

For consumers, they can allocate money between housing and commuting:

- $r(x_\text{commuter}) =  \frac{100}{4} - \frac{2}{4}\times x_\text{commuter}$

---

# Example

.hi[Task]: 

-  Derive the bid rent curve for office space, manufacturing, and commuters. Plot all of them. 

--

- Find how land is allocated. Specifically, over what range from the center is office space, manufacturing space, and housing space?

--

---



# Example

.hi[Task]: 


Bid rent curves for office and manufacturing come from zero profit. Commuters curve was given.


- Office: $r(x_{\text{office}}) = 105 - (5+4 \times  x_{\text{office}})$

- Manufacturing: $r(x_{\text{manufact}}) = 75 - (5+2 \times x_{\text{manufact}})$

- Commuters: (given) $r(x_\text{commuter}) =  \frac{100}{4} - \frac{2}{4}\times x_\text{commuter}$


--

- Office firms locate in the range of $x$ in $[0,15]$

-  Manufacturing firms locate in the range of $x$ in $[15,30]$

- Commuters locate in the range of $x$ in $[30,50]$

__Q1)__  How does COVID19 impact housing/rental prices?

  - .hi[A1:] [_The Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic on the Demand for Density: Evidence from the U.S. Housing Market_](https://dallasfed.frswebservices.org/research/papers/2020/wp2024.aspx) (.pink[Liu & Su, 2020])
  
__Findings:__

> The pandemic has led to a greater decline in the demand for housing in neighborhoods with high population density. We further show that the reduced demand for density is partially driven by the diminished need of living close to jobs that are telework-compatible and the declining value of access to consumption amenities.

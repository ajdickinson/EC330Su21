# Housing markets 

Distinguish the following two markets:

- .hi[Rental Market:] Supply and Demand for rentals

- .hii[Housing Market:] Supply and Demand for houses

--

Why is it important to distinguish these? Aren't they both markets for living spaces? .hi[Discuss]

--

 - A house is an asset. A month of rent is not
  
 - Homeowners are much less mobile than renters
  
---

# Homeownership

.center[.hi[Why is buying a home different than buying a pair of jeans?]]

--

.center[.hii[Houses are a major investment and store of value (equity)]]

--

Homeownership remains a key component of household wealth
- The value is subject to some uncertainty
 
--

<br>
 
Purchasing a home is a .hi[dynamic] (forward-looking) decision

Jeans (a pure consumption good) is not really a store of value

--

# Housing crisis (summarized)

.center[.hi[What caused the housing market crash in 2007?]]

--

.center[.hii[Among many other things, subprime mortgages]]

--

Mortgage lenders took too much risk by extending loans the millions of Americans who could not afford them

--

These high risk, subprime loans were bundled into different "troughs" with lower risk loans and sold them to banks

--

Rating agencies didn't fully understand the risk associated with these loans and granted high grades (AA) to highly risky investment products

--

When housing prices stopped growing, and high interest rates set in on adjustable loans, massive amounts of people defaulted

--

People shorted the banks on their investments and it lead to a massive financial crisis

# Rental markets

---
# Rental market model

Just like labor markets, each city has its own market for rental units 
- Consists of suppliers (absentee landlords) 
- Individuals making optimal housing demand decisions

--

.hi[Important:] Firms (landlords) supply housing to households

--

.hi[Assumptions:]

--

.hii[(i).] No individual landlord can influence the price of rents

--

.hii[(ii).] Landlords decide how much housing to provide

--

.hii[(iii).] The amount of housing they provide will again come from profit maximization


---
# Rental market model: Perf Comp

\begin{align*}
\pi(Q) = P*Q - TC(Q)

.hi[Note:] Now cost is a function of quantity

Implicitly we are assuming that at any quantity, the firm will use the optimal level of labor and capital

--

Marginal profit equals zero , $\frac{\Delta \pi(Q)}{\Delta Q}= 0$:

# Monopoly

# Rental market model: Monopoly

Now let's consider the .hi[monopoly] situation:

--

.hi[Assume:]

--

.hii[(i).] One seller of the good (rental units)

--

.hii[(ii).] The monopolist has market power; ability to set prices

--

.hii[(iii).] The monopolist is a profit maximizer

---
# Rental market model: Monopoly

Equilibrium relies on the assumption that firms maximize profits

--

Now TR is a function of quantity

\begin{equation*}
TR = P(Q)*Q
\end{equation*}

--

Quantity of houses that the monopolist produces changes the market price

--

$P(Q)$ in this context is called the inverse demand function
  
--

.hi[Profit is given by:]

\begin{align*}
\pi(Q) = P(Q)*Q - TC(Q)
\end{align*}
  


---
# Rental market model: Monopoly

Profit Maximization gives us the familiar $\frac{\Delta \pi(Q)}{\Delta Q} = 0$

\begin{align*}
\frac{\Delta P(Q)*Q}{\Delta Q} - \frac{\Delta TC(Q)}{\Delta Q} = 0

# Rents Across Cities

.hi[Key question:] What causes rental curves to vary across cities?

--
  
Supply curves across cities are impacted by: local construction costs, land available for development, and land-use regulations

--

.hi[Local construction costs]: shifts intercept (labor is more expensive for all firms in one area vs another)

.hii[Land available for development] and .hi-gold[land use regulations:] slope (changes in the marginal cost) of developing land. 

--

.qa[A]: Less land available to develop $\rightarrow$ .hi[oppurtunity cost of developing increases] for each next plot of land. Prices get bid up faster. Similar intuition with land-use regulations

# A Model

Do Land-Use regs and rent control interact? Absolutely! Let's model it

--

\begin{align*}
P(Q_d) &= 20 - 2*Q_d\\
P(Q_s) &= 8 + Q_s\\
\end{align*}

Compute the equilibrium. Graph it, if that is helpful

--

- Now suppose the government ratchets up land-use regs. New supply is given by:

\begin{align*}
P(Q_s^{new}) = 8 + 2*Q_s^{new}
\end{align*}

---
# Example

Old eq: $Q^* = 4$, $P^* = 12$

New eq: $Q^* = 3$, $P^* = 15$


Government comes in and says the rents are too high. Rent control set at $12$ per unit. Now you have:

\begin{align*}
12 = 8+2*Q_s \implies Q_s = 2
\end{align*}


---
count: false

\begin{align*}

#A Paradox


.qa[Q]: What is the .hi.orange[paradox] between the things I have just discussed?

--

.qa[A]:  _Despite_ the world "becoming .hi[smaller]" the urban population has rapidly .hi[increased]
  
  - Would you expect the opposite? Why?

--

This is .hi.purple[motivation] to ponder the question: why do cities .hi.purple[exist]?

--

- __Fundamentals__ of this question can also inform why:

  - Some cities have .hi.purple[succeeded]

  - and other have .hi.purple[declined]

# Why do Cities Exist?

What do you think? .hi.purple[Discuss]

--

This question has a pretty simple answer. What is it?

--

<center>
<font size="15"> Trade </font>
</center>

--

<center>
<font size="15"> with a few caveats... </font>
</center>

--


Suppose there was .hi[no trade]. What would we need for this to be true? _Would this lead to no cities?_

--

- Even with trade, _possible_ that households trade amongst themselves (still no cities)

--

---




name: trade
# No Cities

--

1) No differences in .hi[productivity] of __land__ _or_ __labor__

  - Differences in either of these generate .hi[comparative advantage]
  
--

--


2) Constant Returns to Scale (CRS) in .hi[Exchange] & transportation

--

  - .hi.purple[Per unit price] to .hi[trade] goods _is the same_ no matter how much is traded 
  
  - No need for distributors/exchange firms
  
--

--

3) CRS in .hi.orange[Production]

--

  - .hi.purple[Per unit price] of .hi.orange[producing] goods is the same no matter how many you produce
  
  - .hi.orange[Factory] (a collection of workers and capital) can make goods _at the same cost_ as .hi.orange[homes]
  
--

---


# Relax Assumption 1

.hi.purple[Question]: Is all land and labor equally productive? 


--
 
.hi.purple[Answer]: Nope. Let's relax this assumption

  - Differences in productivity across cities generate .hi[comparative advantage]

--

---


# Back to 201

##Reminder:


  - .hi.slate[Absolute Advantage] (AA): An economic agent or entity has .hi.purple[AA] in exchange if they can produce more of the good in the same amount of time 
  
      - or the same amount of the good in less time
 
--
 
  - .hi.slate[Comparative Advantage] (CA) : An economic agent or entity has .hi[CA] in exchange if they can produce the good at a lower _oppurtunity cost_

--

--

.hi.slate[Production Possibilities Frontier] (PPF): All possible combinations of goods that an economic agent or entity can produce

--

---

# PPF's

.hi.slate[Example]: 

  - Suppose we have two countries, A & B. They are producing guns and oil
  
Each counties PPF is .note[given] by:

- .hi[County A]: $\color{#e64173} {Guns_A = 10 - 2*Oil_A}$

- .hi[County B]: $\color{#6A5ACD} {Guns_B = 20 - 5*Oil_B}$


--

1) Graph each countries PPF

2) Determine who has the AA in each good and who has the CA in each good

--

---

# PPF Heuristics

When looking at PPFs, to determine:


1) .hi.purple[AA]: Check .hi[intercepts]
  
  - Whoever has higher - valued .hi[intercept] has the .hi.purple[AA] in production of that good


2) .hi.purple[CA]: Check .hi.orange[slopes]

  - A __steeper__ .hi.orange[slope] indicates .hi.purple[CA] on the vertical axis
  
  - A __shallower__ .hi.orange[slope] indicates .hi.purple[CA] on the horizontal axis

# Relax Assumption 2

In absence of scale economies, households trade directly<sup>.hi[†]</sup>


.footnote[
.hi[†] Scale economies: _bigger_ $\rightarrow$ _cheaper per unit_

]

--

- .hi[CRS in Exchange]: $\implies$ households are just as efficient at executing trades as firms (no cost benefits to scaling)

- No reason to pay a firm to do so (and thus no reason to pay for density)
--
---


# Relax Assumption 2

However, firms generally have lower transaction costs than individuals, so individuals are willing to pay firms to facilitate trade (meaning there are economies of scale in exchange). 

- To fully take advantage of scale economies in exchange, firms locate such that they minimize costs of distributing output 
  
  - They locate near rivers, ports, crossroads, etc $\implies$ higher prices of land $\implies$ density

- .hi[Result:] trading cities. This is what we had before the industrial revolution.

---



name: factory
# Relax Assumption 3

Suppose we relax the CRS in production assumption. Specifically, let's suppose workers at a factory can produce a good at a cheaper per-unit cost than at home

--

##Example

Consider a shirt making factory

  - .hi[Home] production: $20$  p shirt. .hi[Factory]:  $12$ p shirt
    
    - economies of scale
  
--

  - Locates in a town with 50 miles to east and west of villages
  
    - 50 cents/mile to ship west.  20 cents/mile to ship east
--

--

---


#Factory Towns

Under what condition will a consumer purchase the shirt from a factory over home?

\begin{align*}
\underbrace{p_f}_\text{factory price} + \underbrace{t \times d}_\text{transit cost = cost p mile$\times$miles} \leq \underbrace{p_h}_\text{Home Price}
\end{align*}

--

.qa[Questions]:

1. Graph the cost of shirts throughout the entire region

2. Find the .hi.orange[market area] of the town

--

  - Find the __sum__ of the .hi.orange[maximum distances] to the east and west that consumers will purchase the shirt from the factory
--

--

---

#Regional Costs

    geom_text(aes(x = 3, y= -2, label = "50 mi W"))



```

#Market Area Calculation

Market area depends on which side we are looking at. Let $m$ denote miles

- .hi.slate[West]
  
  - Consumers buy from factory if 
  
  $12 + .5*m_{west} \leq 20 \implies m_{west} \leq 16$


- .hi.slate[East]

  - Consumers buy from factory if 
  
  $12 + .2*m_{east} \leq 20 \implies m_{east} \leq 40$

__Market area__: $40+16 = 56$
---


# Factory Towns

1. Would workers rather live .hi.orange[closer] or .hi[further] from the factory?
  
--
  
  - .hi[Closer!]
    
--

2. What happens to land-prices .hi[close] to the factory?

--
  
  - They .hi.purple[increase]
  
--

3. What happens to .hi[density]?

--

 - It will .hi.purple[increase] 
--

__Result:__ Factory town!

# Clustering

So we explained _why_ cities exist. Can we explain why there might be more than one firm?

- Let's start by asking why firms cluster. Where to start? __Axiom 5__

--

__Axiom 5__: .hi[_Competition generates zero economic profit_]

--


- If a firm is making positive economic profit, more firms enter the market

- What happens to the profit per firm as more firms enter?

--

- It decreases. Eventually goes to zero

--

---

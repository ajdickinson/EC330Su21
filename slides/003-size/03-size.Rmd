name: paradox
# Paradox: Why do cities exist?

Considering the urban population trends and technological shifts, .hi[there seems to be a paradox]

--

.qa[Q]: If the world is getting "smaller", why are urban populations booming?

--

This paradox motivates the question: 

--

.center[.hi[Why do cities exist in the first place?]]

--

.center[
  .hii[Why have some cities succeeded?]
  ]
  
--

.center[
  .hi-gold[Why have some cities failed?]
  ]
  
--

Let's use insights from economic models to answer these questions from an economic perspective


---

# Paradox: Why do cities exist?

What do you think?

--

There is a pretty simple, one-word answer. .hi-pink[Any guesses?]

--

.center[.bigger[.hi[Trade]]]

--

.center[.hi[with a few caveats...]]


--


First, suppose there was .hi[no trade]

--

  - What would we need for this to be true? 
  
--

  - _Would this lead to no cities?_

--

- Even with trade, _possible_ that households trade amongst themselves (still no cities)?*

---

# EC 201 Review 016: Trade

.ul[.hi[Definitions:]]

--

  - .hi[Absolute Advantage] (AA): An economic agent or entity has .hi-slate[AA] in exchange if they can produce more of the good in the same amount of time 
  
--
 
  - .hi[Comparative Advantage] (CA) : An economic agent or entity has .hi-slate[CA] in exchange if they can produce the good at a lower _oppurtunity cost_

--

- .hi[Production Possibilities Frontier] (PPF): All possible combinations of goods that an economic agent or entity can produce

---

# EC 201 Review 016: Trade - example

.hi[Example]: 

  - Suppose we have two countries, A & B. They are producing guns and oil
  
Each counties PPF is .note[given] by:

- .hi[County A]: $\color{#e64173} {Guns_A = 10 - 2*Oil_A}$

- .hi[County B]: $\color{#6A5ACD} {Guns_B = 20 - 5*Oil_B}$


--

1) Graph each countries PPF

2) Determine who has the AA in each good and who has the CA in each good

# Why do cities exist?

We need land to produce food and resources; dense cities don't provide

--

Cities exist because of human .hi[technology] has created systems of production and trade that defy the natural order

Three conditions must be satisfied:

--

(i). .hi[Agricultural surplus:] People outside cities must produce enough food to feed themselves and city dwellers

--

(ii). .hi[Urban production:] City dwellers must produce goods or services to exchange for food grown by rural workers

--

(iii). .hi[Transportation for exchange:] There must be an efficient transportation system to facilitate the exchange of food and urban products

--

The technology in this case is what we call .hi[trade]

---

# PPF Heuristics

When looking at PPFs, to determine:


1) .hi[AA]: Check .hi-gold[intercepts]
  
  - Whoever has higher valued .hi[intercept] has the .hi-slate[AA] in production


2) .hi[CA]: Check .hii[slopes]

  - A .hi[steeper slope] indicates .hi-slate[CA] on the vertical axis
  
  - A .hi[shallower slope] indicates .hi-slate[CA] on the horizontal axis


---

name: backyard
# Backyard production model

Use a simple economic model to understand the economic incentives behind cities

--

Consider a region that produces and consumers two products:

- .hi[Bread]

- .hii[Shirts]

--

.center[.hi[Let's make three assumptions that would eliminate any incentives for households to geographically cluster]]

--

  - .smallerer[Relaxing each assumption will give us .hii[intuition] about the formation of cities]


---
# Backyard production model

.hi[Model assumptions:]

--

.hi[A01:] There exist no differences in the productivity of land nor labor

  - No comparative advantages
  
--
  
.hi[A02:] Constant Returns to Scale (CRS) in .hii[exchange] and .hii[transportation]

--

  - Per unit price to .hi[trade] goods _is the same_ no matter how much is traded 
  
  - No need for middle man firms to help with distribution
  
--

.hi[A03:] CRS in .hii[roduction]

--

  - The per unit price of production is constant
  
  - No economies of scale $\rightarrow$ households productivity = firm productivity

---
# Backyard production model

.center[.hi[These three assumptions would eliminate exchange and ensure each household is self sufficient:]]

.hi[A01:] Equal productivity

.hi[A02:] CRS in exchange and transportation

.hi[A03:] CRS in production

--

There is no incentive to specialization due to transaction costs<sup>.hi[†]</sup>

--

Locational equilibrium would be uniformly distributed population

- Prices adjust to ensure locational equilibrium<sup>.hi[††]</sup>

.footnote[<sup>.hi[†]</sup>transaction cost is the opportunity cost of the time required to exchange products
<sup>.hi[††]</sup> Axoim 5 of urban economics]


---

# Backyard production model: Relax A01

.qa[Q]: Is all land and labor equally productive? 

--
 
.qa[A]: Nope. Let's relax that assumption

<br>

--

Relaxing A01 will lead to differences in productivity across cities:

$\rightarrow$ .hi-pink[comparative advantages]

$\rightarrow$ specialization + trade

<br>

--

However, specialization and trade will not alone lead to urban growth

---




# Relax A02

In absence of scale economies, households trade directly<sup>.hi[†]</sup>


.footnote[
.hi[†] Scale economies: _bigger_ $\rightarrow$ _cheaper per unit_

]

--

- .hi[CRS in Exchange]: $\implies$ households are just as efficient at executing trades as firms (no cost benefits to scaling)

- No reason to pay a firm to do so (and thus no reason to pay for density)

--

.center[.hi[A4: Production is subject to economies of scale]]

--

A trading firm will use productive inputs such as:

- Large truck for transportation

- Specialized workers

---


# Relax A02

To take full advantage advantage of scale economies firms locate s.t. they minimize costs of distribution

--

.center[.hi[ie. Build near river junctions, crossraods, ports]]

--
  
$\implies$ higher prices of land $\implies$ density

--

.hi[Result:] Trading cities 

- .hi[The growth of trading cities is implied by A04]

--

These are represent the cities that existed before the industrial revolution

- Most city workers did not produce goods but distributed them

- Trade was risky; insurance, credit, banking and legal services sprouted


---



name: factory
# Relax A03

Now relax the final assumption A03

--

Suppose factory workers can produce at a cheaper per-unit cost than HH

--

.hi[Example] (w/ numbers)

Consider the shirt making factory:

  - .hi[Home] production: $20$  p shirt
  - .hi[Factory]:  $12$ p shirt (economies of scale)
  
--

The factory locates in a town with 50 miles to east and west of villages
  
   - 50 cents/mile to ship west.
   - 20 cents/mile to ship east
   
---
# Factory Towns

--

.hi[Market area:] The area over which factories underprice home production of a good

--

Under what condition will a consumer purchase the shirt from a factory?

\begin{align*}
\underbrace{p_f}_\text{factory price} + \underbrace{t \times d}_\text{transit cost = cost p mile$\times$miles} \leq \underbrace{p_h}_\text{Home Price}
\end{align*}

--

.qa[Questions]:

1. Graph the cost of shirts throughout the entire region

2. Find the .hi[market area] of the town

--

  - Find the sum of the .hii[maximum distances] to the east and west that consumers will purchase the shirt from the factory

---

#Regional Costs

.hi[Home production:] 20 per shirt .hi[Factory production:] 12 per shirt

.hi[Transportation costs:] 50 cents/mile to ship west; 20 cents/mile east

# Factory Towns

1. Would workers rather live .hi.orange[closer] or .hi[further] from the factory?
  
--
  
  - .hi[Closer!]
    
--

2. What happens to land-prices .hi[close] to the factory?

--
  
  - They .hi
  [increase]
  
--

3. What happens to .hi[density]?

--

 - It will .hi
 [increase]

__Result:__ Factory town!

# Introduction to Clustering


---

# Clustering

So we explained .hi[why] cities exist.. 

Can we explain why there might be more than one firm?

--

Where to start? .hi[Axoim 5]

--

.center[.hi[A5: _Competition generates zero economic profit_]]

--

Suppose a firm makes a positive economic profit.

--

$\Rightarrow$ additional firms enter the market

--

$\Rightarrow \Pi \rightarrow 0$


---

name: zero_profit
#Example

How many firms are in the cluster?

```{R, cluster_graph, echo = F, fig.height = 5, fig.width = 8, dev = "svg"}
profit = function(x) -x^3+5*x^2

  #create cluster plot
ggplot(data.frame(x=c(0, 6)), aes(x)) + 
  stat_function(fun=profit, col = "purple")+
  geom_vline(xintercept =0, size = 0.5)+
  geom_hline(yintercept =0, size = 0.5)+
  ggthemes::theme_pander(base_family = "LM Roman 10")+
  xlim(0,6)+
  ylim(-20,20)+
  labs(x = "Number of Firms\nIn Cluster", y = "Profit Per Firm")


```

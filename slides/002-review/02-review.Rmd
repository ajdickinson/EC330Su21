.hi[Example]

Suppose we are given the following:

- Supply: $\color{#e64173} {P(Q_s) = 10 + Q_s}$

- Demand: $\color{#6A5ACD} {P(Q_d)  = 20 - 4*Q_d}$

--

.hi[Task:]

.hii[(i).] Carefully graph and label both curves

.hii[(ii).] Compute the Equilibrium

.hii[(iii).] Compute Consumer and Producer Surplus

---
# Example: Solve for the equilibrium

- Supply: $\color{#e64173} {P(Q_s) = 10 + Q_s}$

# Example: Solve for the equilibrium

- .hi[Equilibrium]:

\begin{align*}
10 + Q^\star &= 20 - 4*Q^\star\\
5Q^\star &= 10\\
Q^\star &= 2
\end{align*}

Plug this into either supply or demand equation to get:

\begin{align*}
P^\star = 10 + 2 = 12
\end{align*}

--

- .hi[Consumer Surplus]: 

  - $CS= \frac{1}{2}*(20-12)*(2-0) = 8$
  
--

- .hi[Producer Surplus]: 

  - $PS = \frac{1}{2}*(12-10)(2-0) = 2$
  
---
# Quiz 01:

Using the follow supply + demand functions

.hii[Supply:] $Q(p_s) = 15 + \frac{1}{2} * p_s$

.hi[Demand:] $Q(p_d) = 40 - \frac{2}{3} * p_d$

Determine:

- (i) Graph each curve and label carefully
- (ii). Equilibrium prices ( $p^*$ ) and quantities ( $q^*$ )
- (iii). Consumer surplus
- (iv). Producer surplus

# Review 014: Elasticities

.hi[Elasticity:] A measure of responsiveness of one variable to another

- .hii[in percentage terms]

--

.hi[Common elasticities:]

--

- .hi[Own price elasticity (good x)]: Measures how much quantity demanded for .hi[x] will respond to a one percent change in the price of good .hi[x]
  
    - Formula: $\varepsilon_{x, P_x} = \frac{\%\Delta Q_x}{\%\Delta P_x}$
--

- .hi[Cross price elasticity (goods x,y)]: Measures how much quantity demanded for .hi[x] will respond to a one percent change in the price of .hii[y]
    
    - Formula: $\varepsilon_{x,P_y} = \frac{\%\Delta Q_x}{\%\Delta P_y}$
    
---
# Review 014: Elasticities (examples)

Own price elasticity:

--

Cross price elasticity:

---
# Review 014: Elasticities

Suppose $\varepsilon_{x, P_x}= -0.5$. What does this mean in words?

--

A 1% change in the .hi[price of good x] will lead to a .5% change in the _opposite_ direction in the .hi[quantity demanded for good x]

--

The equation can be helpful. If $\varepsilon_{x, P_x}= -0.5$, then:

\begin{align*}
\frac{\%\Delta Q_x}{\%\Delta P_x}&= -0.5\\
\%\Delta Q_x &= -0.5 * \%\Delta P_x
\end{align*}


---
exclude: false
# Review 014: Elasticities (questions)


.hi[Review Questions:]

- If $\varepsilon_{x,y}>0$, are these goods complements or substitutes?

--

  - Substitutes, because an increase in the price of $y$ .hi[increases] demand for $x$
  
  - Lame example: cheerios and other cereal
  
--

-  If $\varepsilon_{x,y}<0$, are these goods complements or substitutes?

--

  - Complements, because an increase in the price of $y$ .hi[decreases] demand for $x$
  
  - Lame example: Left and right shoes; pb and bananas

# Review 015: Cost functions

.ul[.hi[Defintions:]]

--

# Review 015: Cost functions

Suppose the price of the output good is $3$ dollars per unit. Suppose a firm's cost function is $TC(Q) = 1+Q$. If the firm produces 8 units of the good, calculate:

- $TR$

- $TC$

- $AC$

- Profit


---

# Review 015: Cost functions

Suppose the price of the output good is $3$ dollars per unit. Suppose a firm's cost function is $TC(Q) = 1+Q$. If the firm produces 8 units of the good, calculate:


- $TR = 3*8 = 24$

- $TC = 1 + 8 = 9$

- $AC = \frac{9}{8}$ 

- Profit $= 24 - 9 = 15$

# The Five Axioms of Urban Economics

As discussed in [lecture 01](https://rawcdn.githack.com/ajdickinson/ec330-summer21/a75becc5e8f60e4d338d1a81d452b5fd09c2a905/slides/001-intro/01-intro.html), we are after some big questions in this course

- Agree upon a few basics before moving onto more complex problems

--

.hi[.ul[Definition:] Axiom]

- A statement which is regarded as being established or evidently true

- Long agreed upon assumptions

--

Axioms are the building blocks upon which theory is built

--

The 5 axioms of urban econ are 5 assumptions that we will take _as given_ throughout the class

- Almost everything moving forward will be tied to one of these assumptions


---

# The Five Axioms of Urban Economics

Some lectures will focus on refining our understanding of these axioms

--

Almost everything we learn ties back to one of the 5 axioms

--

.ul[.hi[(A1).]] Prices adjust to acheive locational equilibrium

.ul[.hi[(A2).]] Self-reinforcing effects generate extreme outcomes

.ul[.hi[(A3).]] Externalities are inefficient

.ul[.hi[(A4).]] Production is subject to economies of scale

.ul[.hi[(A5).]] Competition generates zero economic profit

#Axiom 1

.hi[A1]: _Prices adjust to acheive .hi[locational equilibrium]_ <sup>.hi[†]</sup>


.footnote[.hi[†]: We will refine this definition later in the term]

  - .hi[Locational EQ]: The balance that exists when there is no incentive for firms or households to move
  
--

.hi[Prices] must adjust s.t. there is indifference between locations

$\implies$ No incentive exists

.pull-left[
- Vaccines
- Public schools]
.pull-right[
- Remodeling housing
- Beekeepers]

---
# Axiom 3: Externalities

--

What do these have to do with .hi[efficiency]?<sup>.hi[†]</sup>

  - Private incentives are not aligned with social costs or benefits
  
.footnote[.hi[†]: Highest total surplus]
  
--
  
  - .hi[Example:] In absence of quotas, do people fish too much or too little?
  
--
    - Too much. This harms future fisheries
--

Negative externalities are .hii[overprovided]

Positive externalities are .hi[underprovided]
  
  - So a market with an externality is .hi[inefficient]

# Place-based polcies: Examples


---
# Place-based polcies: Enterpise zones

.hi[.ul[Definition:] Enterprise zone]: 

&gt; A geographic area that has been granted .pink[tax breaks, regulatory exemptions, or other public assistance] in order to encourage private economic development and job creation

Examples:

  - Jersey City, NJ since 1983
  
  - China: Shanghai and Shenzen (Special Economic Zones (SEZ))

# Place-based polcies: Brownfields

.hi[.ul[Definition:] Brownfield]: 

&gt; A geographic area that has previously been developed land that is not currently in use due to industrial and/or commerical pollution

--

Examples include abandoned business such as:
.pull-left[
- Gas stations
- Dry cleaning
- Factories]
.pull-right[
- Mills
- Foundries
]

--

There are several Brownfields in the [Eugene/Springfield area](https://ofmpub.epa.gov/apex/cimc/f?p=CIMC:73::::73:P71_WELSEARCH:97405%7CZipcode%7C%7C%7C%7Ctrue%7Cfalse%7Cfalse%7Cfalse%7Cfalse%7Cfalse%7C(BF_ASSESS_IND%3D%27Y%27)

# Place-based polcies: Brownfields

Brownfields are tremendously expensive to clean up

Furthermore, since the land is no longer being used it is not contributing to local economies

--

[High health costs associated with living near a brownfield](https://michellemmarcus.files.wordpress.com/2019/09/marcus_lust_092319.pdf)

  - Recent publication found that petroleum leaks from underground storage tanks lead to increases in the probability of low birth weights and preterm birth by .hi[7-8 percent]
  
--

Cleaning these up raises .pink[amenity value] of the neighborhood

--

Property values around brownfields are far lower than comparable land
  - What happens to property values? Go up; gentrify

# Place-based polcies: Air quality

_December 2, 1970_: Environmental Protection Agency  (EPA) is Established  

  - Included the Clean Air Act
    - Regulates county level air quality with a vast system of air quality monitors
  
--

.hi[Following years]: amendments to the CAA (expanding scale and scope of EPA)

--

.pull-left[

- .hi[1990:] Additional power granted to state/local authorities to enforce air quality standards
- .hi[1997:] PM 2.5 (particulate matter of 2.5 micrograms or less) standards placed

]

--

.pull-right[
- .hi[2005:] PM2.5 standards enforced

# Place-based polcies: Air quality

Particulate Matter (.hi.orange[PM]) in the US is regulated at the .hi.green[county level]&lt;sup&gt;.pink[†]&lt;/sup&gt;

.footnote[
.pink[†] For more details, look [here](https://www.epa.gov/pm-pollution)
]

--

If a county exceeds certain threshold for .hi.orange[PM] , all firms over a certain size need to pay a pretty big fine
  - Exceptions for fires, other natural events

# Place-based polcies: Discussion

.center[.hi[Why do we care about place-based policies?]]

--

TotC give really good intuition in the chapter about Detroit.

--

.center[.hii[People are mobile and respond to changes in incentives]]

--

Place-based policies influence location decisions

--

.hi[Question]: Why do federal policies impact cities differently?

--

Min wage: might be .hi[binding] in some states, others not
  
- Some labor markets might be competitive. Others not
    
--
  
- Federal Income Tax: Cost of Living varies by state.

# Utility framework

# Utility framework

This next section of the class may be a little more difficult

--

Scratching the surface of how to .hii[model the effects] of a place-based policy

- Need to set up a ton of stuff first 

--

- Some of these examples are based on [Mark Colas'](https://sites.google.com/site/markyaucolas/home?authuser=0) notes

  - Learn more about this in his 400 urban economics class


---
# Utility framework

We talked a little bit about .hi[utility] earlier in the term. What is it?

--

An abstract notion of people's preferences. .hi.orange[Why do we care about this?]

--

We want to think about policies and impact of policies and people location decisions

- Need to think about the changes a policy might have on someone's .hi[incentives]

--

.hi[Recall:] .hii[Higher levels of utility] are more desirable than low levels of utility


---
# Utility framework

.hi[Example]: Preferences over left-shoes and right-shoes may be expressed with the following utility function:

`\begin{align*}
U(\text{left shoes},\text{right shoes}) = \min\left\{ \text{left shoes}, \text{right shoes}   \right\}
\end{align*}`

.qa[Q:] In words, what does this say?

--

.qa[A:] I don't care about consuming more shoes unless I get more of both left and right shoes.

--

.qa[Q:] Give the above utility function, which bundle would I rather consume?

`\begin{align*}
\text{bundle 1}: (10000,1) \hspace{2in}
\text{bundle 2}: (2,2)
\end{align*}`

--

.qa[A:] `\(U(10000,1) = 1 &lt; U(2,2) = 2\)`, so I would rather consume bundle 2

---
# Utility framework

.hi[Main point:] Utility is used to rank outcomes

--

.hi[Remember:] Utility is .hii[ordinal] _not_ .hi-gold[cardinal]

--

This means: we can only speak to the ordering of outcomes, not the levels 

- Many utility functions give equivalent preference rankings

--

.hi[What if utility over shoes was:]

`\begin{align*}
U_2(\text{left shoes},\text{right shoes}) = 10*\min\left\{ \text{left shoes}, \text{right shoes}   \right\}
\end{align*}`

.qa[Q:] Does this represent the same underlying preferences as before?

--

.qa[A:] Yes, because `\(U_2(10000,1) = 10*1 = 10 &lt; U_2(2,2)  = 10*2 = 20\)` 
  
- So the bundle `\((2,2)\)` is still preferred to `\((10000,1)\)`

---
# Utility framework: Locations

.center[.hi[Could we write a utility function over locations?]]

--

.center[.hii[Yes!]]

--

What would a locational utility function take as .hi[inputs?]

--

What do people make location decisions on? 

--

For now, assume people only care about 3 features of locations:

--
  
.center[.hi[wages], .hii[rents], .hi-gold[amenites]]

--

These all vary across locations, right? (first part of this class)

--

Let `\(w_j\)`, `\(r_j\)`, and `\(a_j\)` denote wages, rents, and amenities in location `\(j\)`

---
# Utility framework: Locations

Let `\(w_j\)`, `\(r_j\)`, and `\(a_j\)` denote wages, rents, and amenities in location `\(j\)` 

- `\(j = SF\)`, for example 

--

.hi[General form]: `\(U(w_j, r_j,a_j) = U_j\)`

- This says utility in location `\(j\)` is a function of wages, rents, and amenities, in location `\(j\)`

--

In practice, could write down an infinite number of functions for `\(U(\cdot)\)`

--

.hi[Usual assumptions:]
.pull-left[
- Higher wages are better
- Lower rents are better]
.pull-right[
- More amenities are better]

--

.center[.hii[Is this reasonable?]]

---
# Utility framework: Locations

.hi[Example:] 

Let the utility function be .hi[linear] and assume everyone is identical:

--

`\begin{align*}
U(w_j, r_j, a_j) = w_j - .5*r_j + a_j
\end{align*}`

--

Suppose our two locations are SF and OAK again. If:

-  `\(w_{SF} = 10, r_{SF} = 8, a_{SF} = 4\)`
  
-  `\(w_{OAK} = 8, r_{OAK} = 3, a_{OAK} = 1\)`

--

.qa[Q] How do workers sort across the cities?

--

- `\(U(w_{SF}, r_{SF}, a_{SF}) = 10 - .5*8 + 4 = 10\)`

- `\(U(w_{OAK}, r_{OAK}, a_{OAK}) = 8 - .5*3 + 1 = 7.5\)`

--

Well `\(10 &gt; 7.5\)` so... everyone moves to SF

---
# Utility framework: Locations

.center[.hi[Is it reasonable that everyone would move to SF? What are we missing?]]

--

.center[.hi[Was that last example an example in locational equilibrium?]]

--

.center[.hii[No!]]

In .hi[locational equilibrium], utility is .hii[equalized across locations]

--

Can't have: `\(U(w_{SF}, r_{SF}, a_{SF}) &gt; U(w_{OAK}, r_{OAK}, a_{OAK})\)`

--

&lt;br&gt;

.hi[How can we use locational eq to "fix up" our last example?]


---
# Utility framework: Locations

.hi[Another Problem:] People move and utility is equal across all locations

--

.hi[Thus far], we have assumed .hii[wages] and .hi-gold[rents] do not respond to these choices

--

This is a .hi[bad assumption] right?

--

Let rents, but not wages, adjust to individual location decisions

- Make rents .hii[endogenous] to the model

---
# Utility framework: Rents

Rents in every city given by:

--

`\begin{align*}
r_j(L_j) = 2\times L_j
\end{align*}`

--

- `\(r_j(L_j)\)`: rents _are a function_ of the population (not multiplied)

- `\(L_j\)` is the pop in city `\(j\)`; choosing 2 was arbitrary

--

Suppose we have two cities `\(1\)` and `\(2\)`, with 7 people total: `\(L_1 + L_2 = 7\)`

--

.hi[Utility:] `\(U(w_{j}, r_{j}(L_j), a_{j}) = w_j - .5\times r_j(L_j) + a_j\)`

.hii[Wages:] `\(w_1 = 12\)`, `\(w_2 = 7\)`

.hi-gold[Rents:] `\(r_j(L_j) = 2*L_j\)`

.hi-pink[Amenities:] `\(a_1 = a_2 = 0\)`


---
# Utility framework: Rents example

Suppose we have two cities `\(1\)` and `\(2\)`, with 7 people total: `\(L_1 + L_2 = 7\)`

--

.hi[Utility:] `\(U(w_{j}, r_{j}(L_j), a_{j}) = w_j - .5\times r_j(L_j) + a_j\)`

.hii[Wages:] `\(w_1 = 12\)`, `\(w_2 = 7\)`

.hi-gold[Rents:] `\(r_j(L_j) = 2*L_j\)`

.hi-pink[Amenities:] `\(a_1 = a_2 = 0\)`

--

- .qa[Q:] How many people live in each city? What are rents in each city? 

.hi[Note:] You have .hi[two equations] and .hi[two unknowns] (namely, `\(L_1\)` and `\(L_2\)`)
  
  - `\(U(w_{1}, r_{1}(L_1), a_{1}) = U(w_{2}, r_{2}(L_1), a_{2})\)` (from locational eq) 
    
  - `\(L_1 + L_2 = 7\)` you know the total population

---
# Utility framework: Rents example

Locational eq gives:

`\begin{align*}
w_1 - .5*r_1(L_1) &amp;= w_2 - .5*r_1(L_2)\\
12 - .5*(2*L_1) &amp;= 7 - .5*(2*L_2)\\
-L_1 &amp;= -5 - L_2\\
L_1 &amp;= 5 + L_2
\end{align*}`

--

Population must sum to 7. Thus:

`\begin{align*}
L_1 + L_2 &amp;= 7\\
5+ L_2 + L_2 &amp;= 7\\
2*L_2 &amp;= 2\\
L_2 = 2 \implies L_1 = 5
\end{align*}`

---
# Utility framework: Place based policies

Ok, how do we tie this back into .hi[place-based] policies?

.hi[Example]

--

Initial equilibrium: `\(U(w_{j}, r_{j}(L_j),a_{j}) = k\)` for all cities `\(j\)`

--

Suppose `\(SF\)` implements a 30%, flat, income tax

  - Post-tax wage in city `\(SF\)` is now `\(w^{tax}_{SF} = 0.7*w_{SF}\)` 
  
  - Assume .hi[wages are fixed], but .hii[rents adjust to population]

--

Utility in city `\(j\)` is: 

`\begin{align*}
U(w^{tax}_{SF}, r_{SF}(L_{SF}),a_{SF}) &lt; U(w_{SF}, r_{SF}(L_{SF}),a_{SF})
\end{align*}`

--

If utility is .hi[increasing in wages], then an income-tax lowers utility.

---
# Utility framework: Equilibrium

.center[Can it be an equilibrium if:]

`\begin{align*}
U(w^{tax}_{SF}, r_{SF}(L_{SF}),a_{SF}) &lt; U(w_{SF}, r_{SF}(L_{SF}),a_{SF})
\end{align*}`

--

.center[.hii[No!]]

--

Because `\(U(w_{SF}, r_{SF}(L_{SF}),a_{SF}) = k\)`

So `\(U(w^{tax}_{SF}, r_{SF}(L_{SF}),a_{SF}) \neq k\)`

--

Thus people move .hi[away from SF] and rents fall

So utility goes up in SF until `\(U(w^{tax}_{SF}, r_{SF}(L_{SF}),a_{SF}) = k\)`

---

# Extensions

- This flexible way of modeling gives us many options for modeling place based policies

--

- Other kind of subsidies/taxes: goes into `\(w_j\)`

- Rent subsidies or property taxes: impacts `\(r_j\)`

--

- .qa[Q]: How would you model an increase in public school quality?

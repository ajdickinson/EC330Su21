# Last Time

We discussed some .hi[fundamentals] that lead to the existence of cities

--

.hi-blue[Main takeaway]: 

- Need some reason (.hi[economies of scale]) for cost of cities (high land prices, for example) to be justified
  
--

.hi-blue[Questions]:

  - Why do cities grow beyond one factory?
 
--
 
  - Why are there differences in size across cities?
 
  - Where do cities emerge?
  
---
class: inverse, middle, center

# Firm clustering

---

# Clustering

So we explained .hi-blue[why] cities exist.. 

Can we explain why there might be more than one firm?

--

Where to start?

--

.center[.hi[Axiom 5: _Competition generates zero economic profit_]]

--

Suppose a firm makes a positive economic profit.

--

$\Rightarrow$ additional firms enter the market

--

$\Rightarrow \Pi \rightarrow 0$


---

name: zero_profit
# Clustering example

How many firms are in the cluster?

```{R, cluster_graph, echo = F, fig.height = 5, fig.width = 8, dev = "svg"}
profit = function(x) -x^3+5*x^2

  #create cluster plot
ggplot(data.frame(x=c(0, 6)), aes(x)) +

Which axiom do these data relate to?

--

.hi[A2: Self-reinforcing effects generate extreme outcomes]

---

name: cluster
# Clustering

Why might profit increase ( $\Pi \uparrow$ ) initially as more firms .hi-orange[cluster]?

--

.hi-blue[Firms may mutually benefit from clustering due to:]

--

  - .hi-orange[(i).] Sharing intermediate inputs

  - .hi-orange[(ii).] Labor matching 

  - .hi-orange[(iii).] Knowledge spillovers

  - .hi-orange[(iv).] Labor pool sharing

--

<br>

.center[.hi-blue[Let's look at these in some more detail]]

---

# (i). Sharing inputs

Similar firms .hi-blue[share inputs] to benefit from economies of scale

--

.hi-blue[Example:] High tech firms

--

  - Rapidly changing goods that require sophisticated intermediate inputs

    - Electronic components and testing facilities
    
--

  - Firms will share intermediate input suppliers to help reduce costs
  
--

    - Costs $\downarrow \quad \Rightarrow \quad \Pi \uparrow$
    
--

<br>

.hi-blue[Exists a optimal cluster size that maximizes the benefits of sharing inputs]

---
# (ii). Labor matching

Extending the tech example, consider a labor pool of software programmers

--

The skill sets of these programmers vary greatly

  - Coding languages: C, Javascript, Python, Rust, etc.
  
  - Programming tasks: graphics, AI/ML, OS development etc.

--

Clustering .hi[attracts] more of the kind of workers they want

--

- Firms and workers are .blue[not always perfectly matched]

- Mitchmatches .hii[require training] to eliminate skill gap. .hi[Training is costly]

--

Better for firm if they can find a worker to fill role immediately

- More likely in a cluster

---
# (ii). Labor matching: HS model

.hi[Model assumptions:]


.smallererer[.hi[(i). Variation in worker skills:] Workers have a unique skill set described by an "address" on a circle]

--

.smallererer[.hi[(ii). Firm entry:] Firms enter the market and pick a good with an associated skill requirement]

--

.smallererer[.hi[(iii). Training costs:] Workers incur the cost associated with closing the gap on the circle between their own skill and the skill requirement to produce the good]

--

.smallererer[.hi[(iv). Competition for workers:] Each firm offers a wage to anyone who meets the skill requirement; workers accept the highest net wage
- Net wage $=$ gross wage - training costs]

--

.smallererer[Additionally, assume]

- .smallererer[.hi[A4: Production is subject to economies of scale] to ensure firms hire more than one worker]

- .smallererer[.hi[A5: Competition generates zero economic profit]] to ensure perfect competition

---
# (ii). Labor matching: HS model

.hi[Consider two cities:] Wages $w = 12$ and training costs $t_c = 24$
.pull-left[
- City A
  - Two firms
  - Four workers (four skill types)

- City B
  - Three firms
  - Six workers (six skill types)]
  
--

.pull-right[
![:scale 50%](figures/four-skills.png)

![:scale 50%](figures/six-skills.png)
]

---
# (iii). Knowledge spillovers

.hi-blue[Knowledge spillovers:] Exchange of ideas across individuals within a space

--

  - One of most important external benefit of a college campus (classroom) is the .hii[peer effects]
  
--

.hi-blue[Examples:]
.pull-left[
- Graduate school
- Jam sessions
]
.pull-right[
- Attending seminars, workshops, and conferences
]

--

Knowledge spillovers increase with more people and more knowledge

--

$\Rightarrow$ Knowledge Spillovers $\uparrow$ $\longrightarrow$ Productivity $\uparrow$

--

.hi-blue[Urban settings:] Silicon Valley, Wall Street, etc.

# Agglomeration economies

.ul[.hi-blue[Definition]]: .hi[Agglomeration Economies]

- Benefits that come when firms and people locate near one another together in cities and industrial clusters

--

> Agglomeration economies are the benefits that come when firms and people locate near one another together in cities and industrial clusters. These benefits all ultimately come from transport costs savings: the only real difference between a nearby firm and one across the continent is that it is easier to connect with a neighbor. Of course, transportation costs must be interpreted broadly, and they include the difficulties in exchanging goods, people, and ideas

Source: [Ed. Glaeser](https://www.nber.org/chapters/c7977.pdf)

name: urban
# Agglomeration economies

Let's refine our language with definitions:

--

i. _.hi[Localization economies]_

- The economic forces that cause clustering that act on firms .hii[within the same] industry
- Local to a particular industry
- Example: Firms in the software industry cluster in Silicon Valley
  
ii. _.hi.orange[Urbanization economies]_

- The economic forces that cause clustering that act on firms .hii[across] industries
- The precense of one firm in one industry attracts firms from different industries
- Example: Universities; corporate headquarters
  
---

# Localization Economies

A _.hi[localization economy]_ occurs when an increase in the size of an industry leads to an increase in productivity of production

.center[.hi[Why?]]

--

Evidence of higher .hi[labor productivity]

- Higher output $\rightarrow$ more productive workers (Henderson, 1986)
  
- Tech workers benefit more from .orange[knowledge spillovers] than manufacturing (Mun & Huchinson, 1995)

--

Evidence of higher .hi[rates of entry]

- More firms are born where .hii[output is higher]; that is, where the industry is clustered (Carlton, 1986)

---
# Urbanization Economies

_.hii[Urbanization Economies]_ are when the size of a city leads to an increase in productivity

.center[.hi[Why?]]

--

.hi[Sharing intermediate goods]: (banks, accountants, hotels, transport services)
  
--

.hi[Pooling]: workers move from industries with low demand to high demand (.orange[across] sector)

--
  
.hi[Matching]: common skills across sectors (excel, for example)

--

<br>

Urbanization Economies result in .hi[large, diverse cities]


---
# Examples

Two major examples of .hi[localization] & .hi.orange[urbanization] economies:

1) .hi-blue[Silicon Valley]

--

- .hi[Localization]: firms locate close to each other to share .orange[high-skilled labor pool] despite very high rents

--


2) .hi-blue[Los Angeles]

--

- .hii[Urbanization]: Not really any super dominant industries, yet it continues to grow

# City Size

.hi[Why are some cities big while others are small?]

--

We've seen why agglomeration economies explain why .hi[firms] cluster.

--

But how to agglomeration economies explain why .hii[people] cluster?

--

- Agglomeration economies increase productivity and lead to higher wages in larger cities

<br>

.hi[Let's look at some data of city populations in the US]

# City Size in the US

```{R, zipf_one, echo = F, fig.height = 5, fig.width = 8, dev = "svg"}

There seems to be a functional relationship within city sizes and rank within a single country

# Size: Zipf's Law

.hi[Zipf's Law] of city size can be expressed as:

\begin{align*}
rank = \frac{C}{N}
\end{align*}

.hi[Where]

- C represents a constant for a country/region

- N represents the population level

--

We can use the function described by Zipf's law to approximate city size based on rank

---
# Zipf's Law: Example

Assume the .hi[third] ( _rank_ ) largest city in a region has .hii[200,000 people] ( $N$ )

- Use Zipf's law to figure out how many people are in the _fifth-largest_ city


.hi[Two steps:]

--

1) Calculate the constant $C$:

\begin{align*}
3 &= \frac{C}{200,000}\\
C &=  600,000
\end{align*}

--

2) Use that info to calculate the population of the 5th largest city:

\begin{align*}
5 &= \frac{600,000}{Pop_5}
\end{align*}

---



# Zipf's Law: Example

.hi[Two steps:]

1) Calculate the constant $C$:

\begin{align*}

\end{align*}

2) Use that info to calculate the population of the 5th largest city:

\begin{align*}
5 &= \frac{600,000}{Pop_5} \implies Pop_5 = 120,000
\end{align*}

# Zipf's Law: Intuition

.qa[Q]: In words, what does .hii[Zipf's law] tell us about the relationship between .hi[rank] and .hi[city size]?

--

.qa[A1]: In words, this equation says:

  - .hi[A few] cities will be big

--

  - There is a .hi[big drop] in population as rank increases
  
  - Most low rank (high number) cities are .hi[pretty similar] in size

# Quiz 02: Zipf's Law

Answer the following two part and submit a pdf to Canvas before our next class (Monday). Points will be taken off for poor scans and/or handwriting.

(a). Assume that the Zipf's Law for cities is exactly true. If the .hi[fourth-largest] city in a region has .hii[2.5 million] people, how many people live in the region's .hi[largest] city? Show your work.

<br>

(b). How many people live in the region's .hi[tenth-largest] city? Show your work.

# Primate Cities

.hi-blue[Definition]: A .hi[primate city] is


> A major city that works as the .hi.purple[financial, political, and population center of a country] and is not rivaled in any of these aspects by any other city in that country. Normally, a primate city must be at least .purple[twice as populous as the second largest city] in the country.


.hi[Examples]:

.smallerer[
.pull-right[
.hi[Percent of Total Population]
- 45.8%
- 35.5%

]
]

# Why Primate Cities?

What might generate primate cities?

- Large .hi[economies of scale] in exchange

- Inadequate .hii[transportation infastructure] elsewhere

--

- .hi[Political factors]?

--

  - Easier for dictators to bribe, surveil populations of a primary city (?)
  
  -  Capital cities with dictatorships are _45%_ larger than capital cities of other countries
    
   - Is this relationship .hi.orange[causal]? <sup>.orange[†]</sup>

--

.footnote[
.orange[†] Maybe somebody does. But you definitely can't say from the 45% number. Much of modern econ is about figuring out when relationships _are_ causal. For a completely unrelated, but informative and entertaining example, see [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6YrIDhaUQOE&t=133s).

# Why Zipf's Law?

.qa[Q]: _Why does Zipf's Law_ do pretty well in general at describing city size?

--

.qa[A]: __Axiom 2__: _.hi[Self-reinforcing effects] generate extreme outcomes_

  - "Winner take all" situations from policies, agglomeration, knowledge spillovers, etc.

--

  - Wages grow, workers in, firms enter, $\rightarrow$ labor demand $\uparrow$ $\rightarrow$ wages grow . `r emo::ji("repeat")`
  
--

.qa[Q]: What slows this process down?

--

.center[.hi[Increases in costs lead to diseconomies of scale]]

---
# Size

Why do costs increase as workers move in? (Diseconomies of scale?)

(i). .hi[Commute costs increase]

  - More people $\implies$ more congestion (all else equal)
  
--

(ii). .hi.green[Pollution] increases

  - More workers $\implies$ more production $\implies$ more .green[pollution]?

--

(iii). .hii[Disease]

--
  - Early 1900's (US), living in a city $\rightarrow$ life expectancy $\downarrow$ 5 years
  
  - Now, the US's largest cities life expectancy exceeds the national average

--

  - Life expectancy in cities is lower than rural areas in developing economies. .hi[Why?]

---
name: utility
# Utility

What can we use to model the value individuals place on different attributes of cities? __Utility__

--

.hi-blue[Utility] is an abstract notion of peoples preferences. A few assumptions:

--


.hi[(i).] Higher levels of utility are .orange[preferred] to .blue[lower] levels. And more consumption is better than less

.hi[(ii).] Utility is _ordinal, not cardinal_ meaning only the .hii[rank] of the number matters, not the level

--

# Locational Equilibrium

.hi[Locational Equilibrium] occurs when utility levels (valuations) across cities are the same for all workers

--

In a system of cities, .hi[migration] has a .hii[self-correcting] effect

- Locational equilibrium is stable when the utility curve is downward sloping

- Cities tend to be too large rather than too small

--

In practice, we usually do this by .hii[worker type] (demographic, income level, education, etc)
  
- For now, we will just consider the case when .hi[all workers are equivalent] (_but not cities_)

- This assumption is mostly for accounting purposes. Best to start simple.

# Locational Eq: Implications

Back to the .hi.orange[real world]: _Why is this framework useful?_

  - If utility really has this shape, what does this mean for policy?
  
--

_Policies that impact the .hi[spatial distribution] of the population can have far flung effects on individuals it was not designed to impact, .hii[via migration]_


.hi-blue[Example]:

--

- Local school quality improvements $\rightarrow$ increased prices. Higher utility from school quality, lower from higher prices. Some people may be displaced? (Gentrification)
  
--

- Net effect could be positive, but there will be winners and losers
    
--

More on this later in the term (.hii[place-based] policies).

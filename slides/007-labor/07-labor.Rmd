.hi[Why care about labor markets in urban economics?]

Cities provide incentives for firms and workers to locate close to each other

Density of a city is generated entirely by incentives in the labor market

# Urban labor Markets: Labor demand

What do both fields have (somewhat) in common?

.ul[.hi[Definition:] Labor Demand]

  - Set of quantities of labor demanded corresponding to a _set_ of wages
  
--
 
.qa[Q:] What's the difference between changes in:
.pull-left[
- _labor demand_]
.pull-right[
- _quantity of labor demanded_]

--

$\Delta$ Labor demand: Shift in the demand curve

$\Delta$ Quantity of labor demanded: Movement along a demand curve

---
# Urban labor Markets: Labor demand

We will start with the .hi[competitive] model:

--

.ul[.hi[Assumptions:]]

.hii[(i).] Firms seek to maximize profits

--

.hii[(ii).] Markets are perfectly competitive (in .orange[both] inputs and output)

--

$\Rightarrow$ No individual firm can influence the price of labor (or other inputs)
  
$\Rightarrow$ No individual firm can influence the output price

--

Are these assumptions reasonable? Discuss

--

---
# Urban labor Markets: Labor demand

Derive a condition for EQ labor the firm will hire in the competitive model?

\begin{align*}
\pi &= P*Q - TC
\end{align*}

---
# Urban labor Markets: Labor demand

Derive a condition for EQ labor the firm will hire in the competitive model?

\begin{align*}
\pi &= P*Q - TC\\
\pi &= \underbrace{P*F(L,K)}_\text{TR} - \underbrace{w*L-r*K}_{\text{TC}}
\end{align*}

where:

--

 - $P$: Output price
 
 - $F(L,K) = Q$: Quantity produced (function of labor and capital)
 
  - $Q = F(L,K)$
  
--

 - $w$: Wage rate; $L$: total labor employed $\Rightarrow w*L =$ cost of labor
 - $r$: rental rate; $K$: capital $\Rightarrow r*K =$ cost of capital 

---
# Urban labor Markets: Labor demand

.hi[Claim]: Firm hires labor iff the _marginal profit_ w.r.t to labor is positive. 

--

.hi[.ul[Definition:] Marginal Profit w.r.t to labor] ( $\frac{\Delta \pi}{\Delta L}$ )

  - The change in profit from hiring an additional unit of labor

--

.hi["Proof":] (Too many cooks)

- If $\frac{\Delta \pi}{\Delta L} <0$, added profit from an additional unit of labor is negative (ie. a loss), so the firm _should not_ hire the next unit

--

- If $\frac{\Delta \pi}{\Delta L} > 0$, added profit from an additional unit of labor is positive (ie. a gain), so the firm _should_ hire the next unit

--

- If $\frac{\Delta \pi}{\Delta L} = 0$ Optimal allocation for the firm. Can't do better

--

---
# Urban labor Markets: Labor demand

.ul[.hi[Definitions:]]

- .hi[Marginal Product of Labor]: Change in output from an additional unit of labor employed

--

  - $MP_L = \frac{\Delta F(L,K)}{\Delta L}$

--

- .hi[Marginal Revenue Product of Labor]: Value of the change in output from an additional unit of labor employed

--

  -  $MRP_L = P*\frac{\Delta F(L,K)}{\Delta L}$

---
# Urban labor Markets: Labor demand

So what is $\frac{\Delta \pi}{\Delta L}$?

--

\begin{align*}
\frac{\Delta \pi}{\Delta L} = P*\frac{\Delta F(L,K)}{\Delta L} - w*\frac{\Delta L}{\Delta L}  
\end{align*}

---
# Urban labor Markets: Labor demand

So what is $\frac{\Delta \pi}{\Delta L}$?

\begin{align*}
\frac{\Delta \pi}{\Delta L} &= P*\frac{\Delta F(L,K)}{\Delta L} - w*\frac{\Delta L}{\Delta L} \\
&= P*MP_L - w\\
& = MRP_L - w
\end{align*}

--

Now, set $\frac{\Delta \pi}{\Delta L}=0$ to get the labor demand curve:

\begin{align*}
 MRP_L - w =0 \implies MRP_L = w
\end{align*}

# Urban labor Markets: Labor demand

Why might .hi[labor demand] curves vary across cities?

--

.hi[(i).] Differences in productivity across cities (agglomeration)

--

.hi[(ii).] Variation in (business) taxes across cities

--

.hi[(iii).] Industrial public service infastructure (electricity, water, gas pipelines)

--

.hi[(iv).] Land use policies
  - stricter zoning $\implies$ higher land price $\implies$ less money for other inputs

--

.hi[(v).] Demand for a city's exported goods

# Urban labor markets: Supply

---
#Labor Supply

Labor supply is driven from location decisions of individuals. What generates location choices?

--

1) .hi[Wages]

2) Rents

3) Amenities

4) Other, individual specific stuff (like birth location)

--

---
# Labor Supply

A _set_ of quantities of labor supplied corresponding to a _set_ of wages. 

.qa[Q1]: What causes _movement along_ the labor supply curve?

--

- A change in wages. That's it!

--


.qa[Q2]: What causes a _shift_ of the labor supply curve?

--

1) Changes in amenities (building of a nicer school, eroding of air quality)

2) Changes in residential government expenditures (increase in taxes drives people away, increases in govt spending brings people in)

--


---
# Labor Supply

Knowing how responsive workers are to changes in wages is key for vast swaths of policies

- Estimates for labor supply elasticities are pretty big

- If $\varepsilon_{\text{workforce},\text{wage}} = 2$, what does this mean?

--

.hi.orange[In general] estimated labor supply elasticities are higher for workers with a college degree than without a college degree. What does this mean?

--

  - College educated individuals are more responsive to changes in wages w.r.t to their location decisions

--

--


---

#Equilibrium 

__Defn__

  - A .hi[labor market equilibrium] is a pair of points $(L^*, W^*)$ such that:
  
    - labor supply = labor demand

  - In other words: a labor market eq is where there is no excess supply or demand
  
--

We usually think of cities as being "seperate" labor markets, so the eqs can be different across cities

--

---
# Equilibrium: Example

---
# Min Wage Refresher

Recall from EC201: minimum wages are a form of .hi[price controls]. Specifically, a minimum wage is a:

--

- Price floor: dictates the _minimum_ allowed price for transactions in a marketplace

--

We say that a price floor is .hi.purple[effective] if it has an impact on the market equilibrium

--

  - Price floors that are below the market price are ineffective

#Significance?

__2 Questions__


- Why do we care so much about modeling cities as different labor markets? .hi.purple[Discuss]
  
--

- Do you think all labor markets across cities and industries are competitive? .hi.purple[Discuss]

---
# Some Notes

- All else equal, low tax cities grow faster than high tax cities


  - Elasticity (business activity, taxes)
  
--

  - Across cities: -0.1 to -0.6
  
  -  Within cities: -1.0 to -3.0

--

 - Manufacturers are more sensitive to tax differences

# Competitive Model

We built up labor .hi[supply] and .hi[demand]. Where do these come from?

--

  - Demand: Firms
  
  - Supply: Workers

--

What did we assume about the market structure?

--

- .hi[Perfect Competition]

# Competitive Model

We built up labor .hi[supply] and .hi[demand]. Where do these come from?



  - Demand: Firms
  
  - Supply: Workers



What did we assume about the market structure?



- .hi[Perfect Competition]

  - Firms pay workers their MV of labor (max WTP)
  
  
--

Probably not super reasonable

--

---
# Monopsony

Let's consider a different labor market structure:

--

<center>
<font size="15"> Monopsony </font>
</center>

--

- We say a firm is a .hi[monopsonist] if they are .hi.purple[the only employer] of labor in the area (city)

- We say a firm has .hi[monopsony power] if they have the ability to influence the market wage

--

  - Not to be confused with __monopoly__ (in which there is only one .hi.purple[seller] of a good)
  
  - __Monopsony__ has to do with one .hi.purple[buyer] of a good 
  
--

---
# Examples of Monopsonys

Can you think of any?

--

- Universities (go GTFF!)

- Coal Towns

- Amazon / Walmart Towns?

--




---
# Monopsony

So what do you think the main consequence(s) of .hi[monopsony] are?

<center>
<font size="15"> Monopsonists have the ability to pay a wage below the marginal value </font>
</center>

The consequences?

--

- .pink[Higher profit] for the firms

- Deadweight loss (inefficient outcome)

--

We will formalize this in a few slides, but first lets go over some evidence of local monopsonys


---
# Monopsony: Formalizing the Result

In the competive model, the firm pays the worker $w = MRP_l$. 

--

- Is this what the monopsonist would do?

- Where is this?

--

---
# Recall: The competitive model

Remember: in the competitve model, the firm seeks to maximize profits (but does not influence prices). 

  - The competitive firm hires labor until the marginal profit w.r.t to labor is zero
  
\begin{align*}
\pi &= TR - TC\\
\pi &= TR - wL - rK
\end{align*}

Profit maxing cond: $\frac{\Delta \pi}{\Delta L} = 0 \implies MRP_L -w = 0 \implies w = MRP_L$


---
# Monopsony: Formalizing the Result

With a monopsonist, the amount of labor they hire influences the wage. That is, now

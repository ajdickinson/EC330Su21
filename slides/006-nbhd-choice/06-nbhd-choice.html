# Introduction to neighborhood choice

We have a fairly simple model of .hi-orange[residential choice] (rental prices)

--

.qa[Q:] What factor(s) in the model determine housing demand?

--

.qa[A:] Bid-Rent model assumes commuting costs are the .hi-orange[only factor]

--

.hi[Is this all you consider when deciding where to live?]

--

  - What factors influence neighborhood decision choices?

--

.hi-blue[Examples:]

# Neighborhood choice: Amenities

.ul[.hi[Definition:]] .hii[Amenity] 

An _amenity_ is a .hi[location-specific] consumption good

--

.pull-left[
- Beaches
- Weather
- Public transport]
.pull-right[
- Parks
- Restaurants
- Recreation]

--

Different types of amenities
- Some are nonrival&lt;sup&gt;.hii[†]&lt;/sup&gt;: Theaters, public transport 
- Some are nonexcludable&lt;sup&gt;.hii[††]&lt;/sup&gt;: Parks
- Some are both nonrival and nonexcludable: National defense, sports teams, fireworks

.footnote[.hii[†] Nonrival goods: Accessible by all; usage does limit subsequent use &lt;br&gt; .hii[††] Nonexcludable goods: Impossible to exclude other from consuming]

---
# Neighborhood choice: Amenities

.hi[Two more refined definitions:]

.hi[(i). Exogenous Amenities:] Location-specific consumption good that exist .ul[are not] influenced by where people decide to live

--

  - .hi-gold[Exogenous:] "Deteremined outside of the model" (fall from the sky)
    
  - Weather, geographic characterisitics

--

.hi[(ii). Endogenous Amenities:] Location-specific consumption goods that .ul[are] influenced by location decisions of individuals

--

  - .hi-gold[Endogenous:] "Deteremined within the model"
  
  - School quality, crime, pollution

---
# Neighborhood choice: Amenities

To determine whether or not an amenity is .hi[exogenous] (.hii[endogenous]):

--

.center[_"Will choosing to live here impact the amenity?"_]

&lt;br&gt;

--

  - .hi[Exogenous] _Beaches exist regardless whether people live near by_
 
--

  - .hii[Endogenous] _Crime is a function of the individuals in the area_

&lt;br&gt;

.center[.hi[Let's answer these questions in a simple way.]]

&lt;br&gt;

.center[.blue[Modeling public good: Public parks]]

---
# Demand for public goods

.hi[Consider a simple sorting model for a single, non-rival public good]

--

Model a three-person city with one public good: .hi-blue[Public park]

- Cost .hi[$60 per acre] to build

- Cost is shared equally across all three citizens: .hi-blue[$20 per acre] each

--

Of the three citizen, demand for the park varies:

--

- Low demand: `\(\text{Lyla}: \color{#34b3ff} {P = 30 - 2*\text{acres}}\)`

- Mid demand: `\(\text{Gracie}: \color{#e64173}{P = 40 -2*\text{acres}}\)`

- High demand: `\(\text{Cooper}: \color{#6A5ACD} {P = 50 -2*\text{acres}}\)`

--

.hi-blue[Together they must vote for one park size in a binary election]

---
# Demand for public goods

# Demand for public goods

&lt;img src="06-nbhd-choice_files/figure-html/demand3-1.svg" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

---
# Demand for public goods: Majority rule

For each citizen, optimal park size is found when `\(MB_{park} = MC_{park}\)`

--

Under .hi[majority rule] Gracie's optimal park wins

--

.center[.hii[Why?]]

![](./figures/table8-1.png)

Make kable

--

Gracie is the .hii[median voter]

  - Splits the voting public in half

---
# Alternative to majority rule

Majority rule always leave two citizens unhappy: Cooper and Lyla

--

Suppose the city can be split into .hii[3 identical districts] with 3 citizen

- Each district votes on their own park

- Each citizen knowns each other's preferences

--

.hii[Key assumption:] Citizens pick which district to live in

--

.center[.hi[What is the implication?]]

--

.center[.hi[Similar types sort into the same neighborhood]]

--

.pull-left[
- Lylaville: 5 acre park
- Gracity: 10 acre park]
.pull-right[
- Cooperstown: 15 acre park]

---
# Alternative to majority rule

By .hi[voting with their feet] each citizen sorts themselves into homogenous communities with their preferred public good allocation (park size)

.hi[Now our city has three neighborhoods with homogenous types]

- Accomodates diversity in demand

--

.center[.hi[Is reality this simple?]]

--

.center[.hii[Nope]]

--

.hi[Let's add another layer of complexity:] .hii[Taxes]

---
# Alternative: Property tax

Up to this point, funding for the park is financed with a .hi[head tax]

--

More realistic to model neighborhood sorting using .hi[property taxes]

--

- Allow for variation in preferences + property values:

  - The higher your property value, the more taxes you pay for the park
    - `\(\tau = PV * 10\)`
  - .hi[9] combos: Low-Low, Low-Mid, Low-High, Mid-Low...High-High
  
--

![](figures/table8-2.png)

---
# Alternative: Property tax

![](figures/table8-2.png)

Citizen of PV similar type have incentive to sort together to reduce tax

--

In equilibrium citizen will form .hii[9 different neighborhoods]

.hi[Generates a fragmented system of local government in a metro area]

- Negative implications arise from this sorting

# Becker-Murphy model

Focus on positive externalities for now

- .blue[Assume these increase with income and education]

--
  
.hi[Q:] What is the income mix of neighborhoods - segregated or integrated?

--

.ul[.hi[Becker-Murphy model:]]

--

- Two neighborhoods: A and B - 80 lots each

- Infinite number of households on the market. 

- Only difference between the neighborhoods is income mix

---
# Becker-Murphy model

Individual choices to move are determined by the _rent premium_

.hi[Rent Premium:] Difference in rent between A and B

- `\(RP = R(A)-R(B)\)` (for neighborhood A)

--

- Rent premiums for workers (may) differ by type: `\(RP_{high} \neq RP_{low}\)` 

  - .qa[ie:] Benefit of living close to high types might vary by type

- Land will be allocated to the highest bidder

- Everyone in the same neighborhood pays the same rent/price

# Eq Defn

To be clear, an _equilibrium_ in this model is a point at which the rent premium is in balance across both groups

--

- This will hold when the rent premium curves intersect. Except at full segregation
  
--
  - If the `\(RP\)` for the group listed on the axis is _.pink[higher]_ then this will also be an equilibrium because .hi[there is no tendency for change]
  
  - If the `\(RP\)` for the group listed on the axis is _.purple[lower]_ then population dynamics move away from this point

--

---
# Stable vs Unstable Eq


1) An eq is .hi[stable] if a small movement away will encounter self - .hi[correcting] forces

--

  - An eq is stable if when you move away from it, the pop. dynamics push you back to where you came from

--

2) A eq is .hi.purple[unstable] if a small movement away will encounter self - .hi.purple[reinforcing] forces

--

  - That is, an eq is untable if when you move away from it, the population dynamics push you even farther than where you came from
  
---
# A Heuristic

1) Draw a verticle dashed line at every intersection point

2) For every region between the verticle dashed lines, it must be the case that one of the rent premium curves is above the other

  - If the rent prem curve for the group listed on the axis is .hi[higher], then this group will increase in number. Draw rightward arrows on the axis
  
  - If the rent prem curve for the group listed on the axis is .hi.purple[lower], then this group will decrease in number. Draw leftward arrows


---
# A Heuristic

3) If there are rightward arrows pushing toward 100% in one nbhd, then 100% (complete segregation) is an eq even if the rent prem curves do not intersect there

4) For every eq. value, look at its immediate vicinity

  - If there are arrows moving towards it, it is a .hi.purple[stable eq]
  
  - If there are arrows moving away from it on one or both sides, it is a .hi[unstable eq]

# Neighborhood Sorting


.hi[Externalities] for kids:

  - Good/bad role models as adults
  
  - Classmates in school: focused vs disruptive


--

.hi[Externalities] for adults:

  - Postive: job information, property valuation
  
  - Negative: property values 

--

In general: positive externalities increase with income and education level. Why?

---
# Neighborhood Sorting

These externalities give rise to the following questions:

1. Who gets desirable neighbors?

--

2. Will there be segregated or integrated neighborhoods?

--

3. Will there be sorting or mixing with respect to income, age, race, or some combination of those factors?

  - Is this sorting _de jure_, _de facto_, or both? More on this next time

--

4. What are the implications for the price of land in various neighborhoods?

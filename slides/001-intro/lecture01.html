I want us to discuss the following:


--

 - Grades


 - Course Policies


--

---


# Syllabus: Grading
There are 500 points total.  __**Your grade will be determined by:**__

--

- 40%: Final Exam (1x): 200 points

- 27%: Midterm Exam (1x): 135 points

--

---


# Syllabus: Grading

.qa[Q]: Is there a curve?

.qa[A]: Maybe

--

 In 300 and 400 level classes, roughly 65% of the class will receive A‚Äôs and B‚Äôs. From the syllabus:
 
--

&gt; Your grade will be determined relative to your peers, so during the course, I will not be able to tell you what your exact letter grade is at any point in time, because it depends on everyone‚Äôs overall scores of the class.

---





# Syllabus: Exams

There will be one midterm and one final

--

- __Midterm__: .hi.orange[Feb 11th] (.slate[week 6])

- __Final__: .hi.orange[Wednesday, March 18th @ 12:30]

--

--

- _Absolutely_ .hi[no makeups]

  - However, if approved (by me) you can put .hi.purple[all of the weight from the midterm] on the final (67%) if you must miss the midterm
  
  - I will only do this in __extraordinary circumstances__&lt;sup&gt;.hi[‚Ä†]&lt;/sup&gt;

--


.footnote[
.hi[‚Ä†] Don't be afraid to ask if you are unsure.

#Syllabus: Triumph of the City

In this class you are required to read [Triumph of the City](https://www.amazon.com/Triumph-City-Greatest-Invention-Healthier/dp/0143120549) by Ed. Glaeser. 

- .hi[HW]: Occassional question from assigned reading (in addition to questions from lecture content)

--

- .hi[Exams]: Ocassional question from the book (_if you do the readings_, the questions will be pretty easy)

--

--

- .hi[Book Report]: You are __required__ to turn in a book report at the end of the term

  - I will post instructions and rubric for the book report around week 3
  
  - The syllabus has a reading schedule. You are free to read the book at a quicker rate

--

---


#Syllabus: Homework

There will be 4 written assignments throughout the term:


- Each one is worth .hi.orange[6% of your grade], for a total of 24%

- You __must__ write your answer on the space provided for you on the assignment sheet

--
  
  - .hi[Automatic 50% deduction] from that assignment's score for first offense, and .hi[100% deduction] for each time after

--

- __No late homework assignments__ will be accepted, and no make - up assignments will be given 

- .hi.purple[Start them early], as they will cover _a lot_ of material

---





# Syllabus: Electronics


__ Electronics Policy __

--

- .hi[No cell-phone use during lecture]

  - Only to be used in emergencies
  
  - Cell phone use in non-emergency situations will result in a .hi.orange[1% deduction] from your __course__ grade

--

- Laptops: allowed, but please sit in the back of the room

- Tablets are allowed for note taking

--

__My advice__: take hard-copy (or on the tablet) notes. This helps you:

 1) Stay focused during lecture
  
  2) Retain what was done in lecture

---

#Lecture Notes

As mentioned on Canvas, I will usually post .hi.orange[incomplete] lecture notes within a few hours _before_ lectures

  - Examples won't be filled in, some definitions might be missing
  
--

- I reserve the right to stop doing this if attendance is too low

- __To reiterate__: I believe it is important (for most students) to physically write down definitions, math, and concepts

--

.hi.orange[Complete] slides will be posted to [GitHub](https://github.com/johnmorehouse/EC330_UrbanEcon) _sometime_ after lecture&lt;sup&gt;.hi[‚Ä†]&lt;/sup&gt;


.footnote[
.hi[‚Ä†] This might vary from class to class, but they will be posted within a week of the lecture. 
]


---

# EC201 Review Quiz

There is an __online review quiz__ on canvas due .hi[Monday the 13th @ midnight]. You get one try and have a maximum of 1.5 hours to complete it.

## But why?

--

- Incentivize you to review EC201. .hi.orange[Low stakes]

- Will help you for rest of course

--

## Details

- We will review on Thursday what I want you to know. Review will be similar to quiz

- Quiz will open Thursday after class


---

# First Quiz

If you want to start studying early....


1) Be able to __solve__ for .hi.purple[equilibrium] price and quantity in a model of linear supply and demand

  - Be able to calculate consumer and producer surplus
  
--

2) Know the definition of .hi.orange[profit], .hi.orange[total revenue], .hi.orange[total cost]

  - and how to calculate them (given some information)
  
--

3) Know the definition of .hi[elasticity] and how to interpret it

Review on Thursday, I promise. Also: the the quiz will be extremely similar to our review.

# This Course

This class has two fairly distinct halves:

1. __Philosophy__ &amp; __Tools__

  - Why do cities exist? Why do they grow? Why do they decline?
  
  - Fundamental tools of labor &amp; urban econ (it's all supply and demand)
  
--

2. __Applications__

  - Rent Control &amp; Minimum Wage
  
  - Highways and urban transportation
  
  - Income inequality and environmental issues

--

---

# Checklist

1) .hi[Syllabus]: ‚úÖ

2) .hi.purple[Intro to Urban Economics]

  - __What is urban economics?__

  - __What is a city?__
  
  - __What is a model and why are they useful?__
  


---

name:what_is_it
# Intro to Urban Economics

## What is it?

A mashup between .hi[geography] and .hi[economics].


__Economics__: Study of how people and firms allocate scarce resources.

  - Main framework: utility &amp; profit maximization


__Geography__: Studies effects of location and the environment (hydrology, climate, resources, etc.)


--

__Economics__ + __Geography__  : Study of how individuals and firms choose utility and profit maximizing locations, and consequences of these decisions

--

---


# Intro to Urban Economics


We will study how the __distribution__ of people &amp; firms across space impacts:


--

  - Crime üëÆ‚Äç‚ôÄ

  - The Environment ‚ôªÔ∏è

  - Income growth &amp; Inequality  üí≤


--

We will also examine the efficacy of various .hi[place - based policies]

  - Minimum Wage
  
  - Rent Control
  
  - Land Use Restrictions


---




# Cities

The majority of the US population lives in cities&lt;sup&gt;.smallest[.hi[‚Ä†]]&lt;/sup&gt;

##Questions:

--

1. Do you like cities?

2. What are your top 3 favorite cities (and why?)

3. Are cities at odds with the natural world?

--

##Claim

&lt;center&gt;
&lt;font size="12"&gt;  Location matters &lt;/font&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;

--

Not convinced? Let's look at some data

# Location, Location, Location...

So, where you live has implications for

--

- Your contribution to .hi.green[global carbon emissions] 

  - _Why does this vary across cities?_

--

- Your .hi.purple[wage] and .hi[rent] 

  - _Why does this vary across cities?_

--

--

- Your .hi.orange[economic mobility]

  - _Why does this vary across cities?_
  
--

# Cities

So what is a city? (Pick one of the following)


--

1. This only a question academics would think about

2. It's complicated

3. It's not complicated. Just a lot of people living close together

  - The absence of space between people

--


---

name:what_is_city
# The Census Bureau Says...

--

- __Urban Area__: a .hi.orange[densely settled geographical area] with:

  - Minimum population of .hi[2,500]
  
  - Minimum density of .hi[500 people per square mile]
  
- __Urban Population__:  people living in .hi.orange[urban areas]

- __Metropolitan Area__: an urbanized area with at - least .hi[50k population]

--


--


- __Micropolitan Area__: an urbanized area with at least .hi[10k] but not as many as .hi[50k] people

- __MSA__: handy abbreviation for .slate[both] .hi[metropolitan] and .hi[micropolitan] statistical area

- __Principal City__: the .hi.orange[largest municipality in an MSA]

--

---



name:what_is_model
# Our Toolkit

In this class we will make use of various .hi[mathematical models]


--

1. What is a .hi[mathematical model]?

  - A model is a desciription of a system using .... .hi[math]
  
  - Useful to help __explain__ and __predict__ behavior

--

__**The Canonical Example**__

`\begin{align*}
\text{Supply}:\hspace{.1in} P(Q_s) &amp;= 10 + 5*Q_s\\
\text{Demand}: \hspace{.1in}P(Q_d) &amp;= 20 - 2*Q_d
\end{align*}`

--

This model allows us to make predictions about prices and quantities (from the supply &amp; demand side), _and_ the .hi[equilibrium] price and quantity


---


# Models

1. What are the .hi.purple[pros] of models?

  - Allows for us to be very percise with our language
  
  - Gives us the ability to __predict__ the various aspects of the economy
  
  - Can shed insight on .hi[mechanisms] through which procceses interact
  
--
  
2. .hi.purple[Cons] of models?

  - They require assumptions
  
  - Claim: .hi[Almost] all assumptions are wrong

--

--
  -  __Follow up__ : Not all wrong assumptions are useless
    
--

The ability of the model to .hi.orange[predict data] and .hi.orange[understand mechanisms] determines how useful it is

---

# Models Part II

Did we make assumptions our supply/demand model? .hi.purple[Discuss]


`\begin{align*}
\text{Supply}:\hspace{.1in} P(Q_s) &amp;= 10 + 5*Q_s\\
\text{Demand}: \hspace{.1in}P(Q_d) &amp;= 20 - 2*Q_d
\end{align*}`

--

1. .hi[Marginal values] are diminishing and .hi[marginal costs] are increasing &lt;sup&gt;.hi[‚Ä†]&lt;/sup&gt;

  - Generates downward demand and upward supply
  
2. Demand and Supply are .hi[linear]

3. Demand and Supply are .hi[deterministic]

--

Are these reasonable? .hi.purple[Discuss]

.hi[‚Ä†]: Marginal = Change

class: middle
# Syllabus: Grading

Following department policies, for 300 and 400 level classes roughly 65% of the class will receive A‚Äôs and B‚Äôs.

From the syllabus:

&gt; Your grade will be determined relative to your peers, so during the course, I will not be able to tell you what your exact letter grade is at any point in time, because it depends on everyone‚Äôs overall scores of the class.

---
# Syllabus: Exams

Under .hi[extraordinary circumstances] I will shift midterm weight to the final
- Entirely by my discretion
- Must contact me before the exam via email
    
--

.hi[Drop this course if you are unable to take the scheduled midterm]

--

Roughly 10% of points on the exam will be given for neatness + readability

&lt;br&gt;

.hi[Geared to prepare you for the exams. Think of them as a .ul[study guide.]]

---
# Syllabus: Canvas + Github

--

.hi[Canvas:]

- I hate canvas

--

- But I don't have a better alternative

  - On my to-do list
  
--

- Predominate use is for submitting PS/Quizzes and announcements

--

[Github:](https://github.com/ajdickinson/ec330-summer21)

--

- Light, public course page with links to all course material

# What is economics?

---
# What is economics?

.hi[_The Wealth of Nations_] _by_ [Adam Smith](https://www.adamsmith.org/about-adam-smith) (1776)

--

- Seminal work on economics, four volumes; as important to its field as:

  - Newton‚Äôs _Principia Mathematica_
  
  - Darwin‚Äôs _Origin of Species_
  
--

- "Wealth" ("weal")

  - Money and other assets
  
  - But also well-being, welfare
  
--
  
- Archaic use of "wealth" make it seem like economics is merely the study of how to get rich

---
# What is economics?

In a nutshell:

.center[.hi[Economics is the study of how people make allocation decisions to maximize their happiness when facing limit resources (budgets)]]

--

There is never enough resources to fulfill all human wants

Scarcity gives us constraints and we do the best _we can_ s.t. constraints

--

.hi[Not just money:]
.pull-left[
  - Time
- Health]
.pull-right[
  - Land
- Natural resources]

--

.hi[Economics is very general]; the market lens can be used across many topics

---
# Economics "wheelhouse"

Explain how people and firms .hi[actually behave]; less about how they _should behave_

- Normative vs positive statements

--

  - Normative statements: Matters of opinion that may never be resolved
  
  - .hii[Positive statements:] Matters of fact that can be resolved by data
  
--

- Figure out what the data say for evidence-based policy making

--

.hi[Opportunity cost:] What you have to give up by not putting a resource to its _next-best_ alternative use

- Economist use the word .hii[cost] differently than the general public
  - "Cost" is different than "price"

---
class: inverse, center, middle
# Intro to Urban Economics

---
name:what_is_it
# Intro to Urban Economics

A mashup between .hi[geography] and .hi[economics].


.hi[Economics:] Study of how people and firms allocate scarce resources.

--

.hii[Geography:] Studies effects of location and the environment 
- Hydrology, climate, resources, etc.

--

.hi[Economics] + .hii[Geography]  : Study of how individuals and firms choose utility and profit maximizing locations, and consequences of these decisions

---
# Intro to Urban Economics

We will study how the .hi[distribution] of people &amp; firms across space impacts:

--

.pull-left[
  - City growth üèô
- Crime üëÆ‚Äç‚ôÄ
- The environment ‚ôªÔ∏è]
.pull-right[
  - Income growth &amp; inequality  üìà
- Education üè´
- Employment + wages ü§ë]
  
--

We will also examine the efficacy of various .hi[place - based policies]
.pull-left[
  - Minimum Wage
- Rent Control]
.pull-right[
  - Land Use Restrictions
- Sustainability]

--

&lt;br&gt;

.hi[What are the economic drivers behind urban development?]

---
# This Course

This class has two fairly distinct halves:

1. .hi[Philosophy &amp; Tools]

  - Why do cities exist? Why do they grow? Why do they decline?
  
  - Fundamental tools of labor &amp; urban econ (supply and demand)
  
--

2. .hi[Application]

  - Rent Control &amp; Minimum Wage
  
  - Highways and urban transportation
  
  - Income inequality and environmental issues

---
# What is a city?

--

.hi[The Census Bureau Says...]

--

- .hi[Urban Area:] a .hii[densely settled geographical area] with:
  - Minimum population of .hi[2,500]
  - Minimum density of .hi[500 people per square mile]

--

- Metropolitan Area: an urbanized area with at - least .hi[50k population]
- Micropolitan Area: an urbanized area with at least .hi[10k] but not as many as .hi[50k] people
- MSA: abbrev. for .slate[both] .hi[metropolitan] and .hi[micropolitan] statistical area
- Principal City: the .hi.orange[largest municipality in an MSA]

--

.hi[City:] .blue[Dense collection of people in specific geographic area]

---
# Intro to Urban: Cities

The majority of the US population lives in cities&lt;sup&gt;.smallest[.hi-pink[‚Ä†]]&lt;/sup&gt; and more people will continue to migrate into urban areas

.footnote[.hi-pink[‚Ä†]. 80 - ish percent, according to the Census Bureau]

.hi[Questions:]

--

1. Do you like cities?

2. What are favorite city .hii[amenities]?

3. Are cities at odds with the natural world?

--

.hi[Why do cities exist?]

--

.center[.hi[Location matters]]

---
# Intro to Urban: Location...

Where you live has implications for

--

- Your contribution to .hi[global carbon emissions] 

  - _Why does this vary across cities?_

--

- Your .hi[wage] and .hi[rent] 

  - _Why does this vary across cities?_

--

- Your .hii[economic mobility]

  - _Why does this vary across cities?_
  
--

.hi[We will answer these questions as we progress through this course]

---
name:what_is_model
# Our Toolkit

In this class we will make use of various .hi[mathematical models]

--

1. What is a .hi[mathematical model]?

  - A model is a desciription of a system using .... .hi[math]
  
  - Useful to help .hi[explain] and .hi[predict] behavior

--

.hi[The Canonical Example]

`\begin{align*}
\text{Supply}:\hspace{.1in} P(Q_s) &amp;= 10 + 5*Q_s\\
\text{Demand}: \hspace{.1in}P(Q_d) &amp;= 20 - 2*Q_d
\end{align*}`

--

This model allows us to make predictions about prices and quantities (from the supply &amp; demand side), _and_ the .hi[equilibrium] price and quantity


---
# Models

1. What are the .hii[pros] of models?

  - Allows for us to be very percise with our language
  
  - Gives us the ability to .hi[predict] the various aspects of the economy
  
  - Can shed insight on .hi[mechanisms] through which procceses interact
  
--
  
2. What are the .hii[cons] of models?

  - They require assumptions
  
  - Claim: .hi[Almost] all assumptions are wrong

--
  - .hi[Follow up:] Not all wrong assumptions are useless
    
--

The ability of the model to .hii[predict data] and .hii[understand mechanisms] determines how useful it is

---

# Models Part II

Did we make assumptions our supply/demand model? .hi.purple[Discuss]


`\begin{align*}
\text{Supply}:\hspace{.1in} P(Q_s) &amp;= 10 + 5*Q_s\\
\text{Demand}: \hspace{.1in}P(Q_d) &amp;= 20 - 2*Q_d
\end{align*}`

--

1. .hi[Marginal values] are diminishing and .hi[marginal costs] are increasing &lt;sup&gt;.hi[‚Ä†]&lt;/sup&gt;

  - Generates downward demand and upward supply
  
.footnote[.hi[‚Ä†]: Marginal = Adding one additional unit]
  
2. Demand and Supply are .hi[linear]

3. Demand and Supply are .hi[deterministic]

--

Are these reasonable? Can your behavior be explained by a simple .hi[linear function]?

--

.center[.hi[Does a function even exist?]]

Note: Areas are included in this table if they exceed the stated threshold at any point in the
time series. The estimates are based on the 2010 Census and reflect changes to the April 1, 2010
population due to the Count Question Resolution program and geographic program revisions. All
geographic boundaries for the 2018 population estimates series are as of January 1, 2018. An
"(X)" in the 2010 Census field indicates a locality that was formed or incorporated after the
2010 Census. Additional information on these localities can be found in the Geographic Boundary Change Notes (see https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/geography/technical-documentation/boundary-change-notes.html). For population estimates methodology

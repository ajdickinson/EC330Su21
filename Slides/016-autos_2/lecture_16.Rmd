```

- Marginal external cost is gap between MSC and MPC. 
- Pigouvian tax: set tax equal to size of gap. e,g: MPC + tax = MSC

## Carbon Emissions from Driving

  - Solutions: 
  
    1. Energy Efficient Vehicle (EEVs) Subsidies
    
    2. Gasoline (or carbon) tax
    
    3. VMT tax

  - Private fixed cost is usually higher, but variable cost is lower

  - Social cost is lower (less carbon emissions per mile driven)

# EEVs

.hi.purple[Question]: If an individual switches from an SUV to a prius, will their carbon emissions from driving fall? .hi.purple[Discuss]


--

_Key Assumption_: We can be certain carbon emissions falls if the individual drives the same amount with both cars

  - Is this a reasonable thing to assume?

--

- Probably not, as the cost per mile driven is less than the SUV

# EEVs

__Key Insight__:

<center>
<font size="15"> People drive more when it becomes cheaper to do so </font>

.hi.purple[Questions]: 

  1. What happens to congestion if we subsidize electric/hybrid vehicles? 
  2. What happens to carbon emissions?

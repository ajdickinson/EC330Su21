These consequences are indeed foreseeable. What happened?

- Marginal cost of driving recklessly decreased
  
  - Conditional on being in an accident, you were now more likely to survive
    
  - So more people drove recklessly, then everything else follows (more accidents, more peds/bicyclists killed)

## Pigou strikes again

  - Vehicle miles traveled (VMT) tax: tax per mile driven
  
  - Include external collision cost per mile
  
  - Shuts down gap between social cost and private cost of driving

# Pigou strikes again: Graph


&lt;img src="lecture_16_files/figure-html/pigou-1.svg" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

- Marginal external cost is gap between MSC and MPC. 
- Pigouvian tax: set tax equal to size of gap. e,g: MPC + tax = MSC

## Carbon Emissions from Driving

  - Solutions: 
  
    1. Energy Efficient Vehicle (EEVs) Subsidies
    
    2. Gasoline (or carbon) tax
    
    3. VMT tax

- Energy efficient vehicles consume less gasoline per mile traveled 

  - Private fixed cost is usually higher, but variable cost is lower

  - Social cost is lower (less carbon emissions per mile driven)

# EEVs

.hi.purple[Question]: If an individual switches from an SUV to a prius, will their carbon emissions from driving fall? .hi.purple[Discuss]


--

_Key Assumption_: We can be certain carbon emissions falls if the individual drives the same amount with both cars

  - Is this a reasonable thing to assume?

--

- Probably not, as the cost per mile driven is less than the SUV

---

# EEVs

__Key Insight__:

--

&lt;center&gt;
&lt;font size="15"&gt; People drive more when it becomes cheaper to do so &lt;/font&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;

--

.hi.purple[Questions]: 

  1. What happens to congestion if we subsidize electric/hybrid vehicles? 
  2. What happens to carbon emissions?

- Higher electricity demand deteriorates air quality around power plants

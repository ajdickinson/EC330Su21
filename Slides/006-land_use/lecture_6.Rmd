# Von Thunen Rings

1826: Johann Heinrich von Thunen writes _The Isolated State_

--

- Foundational model of Human Geography

--

- Model describes interaction between cities and landscapes

- Uses basic economic principles to predict changes in land-use

--

--

.hi.slate[What we will do]: use the model to inform .hi[agricultural rents] and predict .hi.purple[physical size] of cities 

---


# Von Thunen Model

Why do we care about a model developed in 1826?

--

- Current theories usually aim to explain the world as it is, or will be in the future

--

- The question of city location can be better understood via economics, history, and geography

--

  - Factors that influence the urban rural interface still largely relevant today

--

--

--


---




# Von Thunen Model

## Assumptions

1) City is located in the center of a .purple[wilderness area]

--

2) Farm land is .pink[equally productive] throughout the city

--

--

3) Farmers behave rationally to .pink[maximize profit]

--

--

4) Farmers transport their goods to a .purple[central location] in the city

--

.hi[What do you notice]?

--

- The rings go out from the center in order of transit cost. .hi.slate[Dairy]: spoils quickly and heavy. .green-bright[Trees]: heavy. .yellow-bright[Grain], easier to transport, but still heavy. .red-bright[Ranching]: land intensive


--

---



# Von Thunen Model: Math

Von - Thunen (rural) rents are derived from the .hi[zero profit condition]. We will work with a simple version, for now, where there is only one "ring" (we can call this agriculture)


--

\begin{align*}
\pi = TR - TC
\end{align*}

--

- $TR = P*Q$

- $TC(x) = F(x)+C + R(x)$

# Von Thunen Model: Math

Von - Thunen (rural) rents are derived from the .hi[zero profit condition]. We will work with a simple version, for now, where there is only one "ring" (we can call this agriculture)


\begin{align*}
\pi = TR - TC
\end{align*}


In the Von Thunen Model,

.pull-left[
- $TR = P*Q$

- $TC(x) = (F(x)+C) + R(x)$
]

.pull-right[
- $R(x)$: Land rents

- Q, P: price and quantity

- C: product expense per unit of commodity

- $F(x)$ transit cost $x$ mi from center

]


---








# Von Thunen Equation

Profit equation is given by:

\begin{align*}
\pi = P*Q - F(x)-C-R(x)
\end{align*}

--

Zero profits imply:

\begin{align*}
P*Q - F(x) - C - R(x) = 0
\end{align*}

Solving for $R(x)$:


--


\begin{align*}
R(x) = (P*Q -F(x)- C)
\end{align*}


--

---


# Von Thunen Equation

So the .hi[agriculturual bid rent] or .hi.purple[von thunen bid rent] curve is summarised by:

--

\begin{align*}
R(x) = (P* -F(x)- C)
\end{align*}

--

In words, what does this equation say? .hi.orange[Discuss]

--

- Higher Revenue ( $P*Q$ ) $\implies$ higher rents (why?)

- Higher Freight cost ( $F(x)$ ) $\implies$ lower rents

- Higher Intermediate goods cost ($C$) $\implies$ lower rents

--

---




# Von Thunen Model: Example


Using 

\begin{equation}
R(x) = (P*Q-C-F(x))
\end{equation}

Find the _radius of arable land_ when freight costs are given by: $F(x) = B*x$.  

  - That is, find the distance from the city where $R(x)= 0$ 

--

- Set  $R(x) = 0$ and solve for x


--



---






# Von Thunen Model: Example

\begin{align*}
R(x) = (P*Q-C- F(x))
\end{align*}

Find the _radius of arable land_ when freight costs are given by: $F(x) = B*x$. 

  - That is, Find the distance from the city where $R(x) = 0$ 



- Set  $R(x) = 0$ and solve for x




\begin{align*}
0 &= (P*Q-C-B*x)\\
C-P*Q &= -B*x\\
\end{align*}


---




# Von Thunen Model: Example


Using 

\begin{equation}
R(x) = (P*Q-C- F(x))
\end{equation}

Find the _radius of arable land_ when freight costs are given by: $F(x) = B*x$. 

  - That is, Find the distance from the city where $R(x) = 0$ 



- Set  $R(x) = 0$ and solve for $x$


\begin{align*}
0 &= (P*Q-C-B*x)\\
C-P*Q &= -B*x\\
\frac{P*Q-C}{B} &= x
\end{align*}


---

# Interpretation
What does the equation $\frac{P*Q-C}{B} = x$ tell us?

1. If the freight rate $B$, increases, will the agricultural area surrounding the city get smaller or larger?

--

 - .hi[Smaller], $\frac{1}{10} < \frac{1}{5}$ 

--

- Interpret this

--

As it becomes more expensive to ship goods, the oppurtunity cost of living further from the city center (where the exchange occurs) increases. Thus, the urban-rural area shrinks in radius

--


---

# Von Thunen: Multiple Sectors

Now consider a version of the model in which we have 2 sectors and __no transit costs__. Profit in each sector is given by

\begin{align*}
\pi_1 &= P_1*Q_1 - R_1(x)\\
\pi_2 &= P_2*Q_2 - R_2(x)\\
\end{align*}

Assume the following:

--


- $P_1*Q_1 > P_2*Q_2$ (rev in sector one is greater than sector 2)

- $R(x) = 20 - x$ 

--

.hi[task]: Show that industry 2 is further away from the center and they pay lower rents. Hint: use the _radius of arable land_ idea from above


---


# Von Thunen Example

\begin{align*}
\pi_1 = P_1*Q_1 - 20 + x_1 = 0\\
\pi_2 = P_2*Q_2 - 20 + x_2 = 0
\end{align*}

Solving for $x_1$ and $x_2$ yields:

- $x_1 = 20 - P_1*Q_1$

- $x_2 = 20 - P_2*Q_2$

Since $P_1*Q_1 > P_2*Q_2$ it follows that $x_1 < x_2$
---


# Von Thunen Model: So What?

The model is a bit dated, but still useful

--

- Transportation costs have, and have always had heavy influence on land prices

- These constraints were larger in the past; still might be useful in explaining urban form of certain cities

--

  - Radius of arable land can give predictions on urban-rural size
  
  - City and agricultural area are intimately linked (Read Cronon's _Natures Metropolis_!)

# Manufacturing Bid Rent

WTP for land from manufacturing firms is a function of the land's accessibility (similar to consumers)

- .hi.purple[Fact]: Urban manufacturing employment is largely decentralized and disperesed
  
  - Most firms locate close to the highway. .hi[Why]? This has not always been the case
  

  
--

- Firms are balancing .hi[freight] and .hi.purple[labor costs]
  
  - Further from labor $\implies$ .purple[higher wage] (to compensate for increased commuting cost)
  
  - Further from shipping center $\implies$ higher .pink[freight cost]

--

---

# Manufacturing Bid Rent

Let's start with a simple model<sup>`r emo::ji("tm")` </sup> . .hi.slate[Assumptions]


--

1) Input & Output .hi[prices] & .hi.purple[quantities] are fixed

--

  - Firm only decides location
  
--

2) Firms .pink[import intermediate goods] and .purple[export output] to other cities via a .hi[central terminal] (train)

--

3) Wage paid is to compensate workers for commuting. Workforce is suburban so wage is .pink[highest at center]

--

4) Firms use horse carts to transport inputs and output to the .hi[central terminal]

  - We will relax this one soon


--


---


# Firm's Bid Rent

What do we use to get the firm's bid - rent equation?

__Axiom 5__: _.pink[Competition generates zero economic profit]_

--

Recall the profit equation:

\begin{align*}
\pi = TR - TC
\end{align*}


--

In this model:


--

- $TR = P*Q$ (fixed, exogenous)

--

- $TC$ is a function of .pink[freight cost, labor cost, and intermediate goods cost]:

\begin{align*}
TC(x) = \text{Freight Cost}(x)+ \text{Labor Cost}(x) + \text{Land Cost}(x)+\\
\text{Intermediate Input Cost}
\end{align*}

--

--

---


# Firm Bid Rent

From here on out, let's call $\text{Intermediate Input Cost} = \bar{I}$


- Invoking zero economic profit, from the last slide we can write:

--

\begin{align*}
TR - (\text{Freight Cost}(x)+ \text{Labor Cost}(x) +\text{Land Cost}(x) +\bar{I} ) = 0
\end{align*}

--

--

- .hi.slate[In words]: .pink[The most a firm would be willing to pay for land then is revenue net of non land cost]. Rearranging:

--

\begin{align*}
\text{Land Cost}(x) = TR - \text{Freight Cost}(x) - \text{Labor Cost}(x) - \bar{I}
\end{align*}

--

.hi.slate[Note]: Land Cost = $P(x)*L_m$, where:


- $P(x)$ is the _.purple[price of land at x miles away from the center]_

- $L_m$ is the _.pink[amount of land the manufacturer uses in production]_ (fixed input at $L_m$)

---


# Firm Bid Rent: Equation

We can replace land cost with $P(x)* L_m$ to get the equation for the .hi[manufacturing bid rent] curve

--

\begin{align*}
P(x)*L_m = TR - \text{Freight Cost}(x) - \text{Labor Cost}(x) - \bar{I}
\end{align*}

--


---




# Firm Bid Rent: Equation

We can replace land cost with $P(x)* L_m$ to get the equation for the .hi[manufacturing bid rent] curve


\begin{align*}
P(x)*L_m &= TR - \text{Freight Cost}(x) - \text{Labor Cost}(x) - \bar{I}\\
P(x) &= \frac{TR - \text{Freight Cost}(x) - \text{Labor Cost}(x) - \bar{I}}{L_m}
\end{align*}

.hi.slate[In words], this equation says:

--

- Higher revenues $\implies$ higher land prices .pink[for every distance] $x$

- An increase in freight costs, labor costs, or intermediate input costs will __decrease__ the price for every distance $x$


--



---


# Linearity

.hi.slate[Note]: If $\text{Freight Cost}(x)$ and $\text{Labor Cost}(x)$ are .pink[linear], then the firm bid rent curve is also .pink[linear]. .hi.slate[Proof]:

--

- Let $\text{Freight Cost}(x) = a_1 + b_1*x$ 

 - .purple[Fixed freight cost] is $a_1$, .pink[variable freight cost] is $b_1*x$

--

- $\text{Labor Cost}(x) = a_2 - b_2*x$

 - .purple[Fixed labor cost] is $a_2$, .pink[variable labor cost] is $b_2*x$

--

--

Let's plug these into our $P(x)$ equation

---




# Linearity

Plugging in yields

\begin{align*}
P(x) &= \frac{TR - a_1 - b_1*x -  a_2 + b_2*x - \bar{I}}{L_m}\\
\end{align*}




---





# Linearity

Plugging in yields

\begin{align*}
P(x) &= \frac{TR - a_1 - b_1*x -  a_2 + b_2*x - \bar{I}}{L_m}\\
P(x) &= \frac{TR - a_1 - a_2 - \bar{I}}{L_m} + \frac{- b_1*x + b_2*x}{L_m}\\
\end{align*}




---



# Linearity

Plugging in yields

\begin{align*}
P(x) &= \frac{TR - a_1 - b_1*x -  a_2 +b_2*x - \bar{I}}{L_m}\\
P(x) &= \frac{TR - a_1 - a_2 - \bar{I}}{L_m} + \frac{- b_1*x + b_2*x}{L_m}\\
P(x) &= \underbrace{\frac{TR - a_1 - a_2 - \bar{I}}{L_m}}_{\text{b}} \underbrace{+ \left(\frac{b_2-b_1}{L_m}\right)}_{\text{m}}*x
\end{align*}

--

- So we have proved that .hi.purple[when freight and variable costs are linear], the .hi[bid rent curve] for manufacturers is also .hi.purple[linear] 

- Slope is given by $m$ in the above equation

--

- Think about how the model's parameters (everything not x and P) impact slope and intercept + intuition (next homework)

--

--

---



# Linearity

So note: the slope of the manufacturing bid rent curve depends on the value of $b_2$ relative to $b_1$. 

- What if $b_1 = 10$ and $b_2 = 2$

--

 - Then $\frac{\Delta P(x)}{\Delta x} < 0$
 
 - Freight cost is high relative to labor rate
 
 - This is true for any $b_1 > b_2$

--

- Manufacturing firms bid most @ center of city when:  $x = 0$

---

# Manufacturing Graph


---

# Back to Reality

How can a model like this help us understand the industrial revolution?

  - What happened to freight costs? .hi[They fell] A few innovations:

--

__Transportation Innovations__:

  - Omnibus (1827)
  
  - Cable Cars (1873)
  
  - Electric Trolley (1886)
  
  - Subways (1895)

--

In our model, what do these innovations do? $b_1 > b_2$

---






# More History 

- The _intracity_ truck (1910): twice as fast and half as costly as the horse-drawn wagon<sup>.pink[†]</sup>


--

- Truck decreased the cost of moving .hi.purple[output] .mono[relative] to the cost of moving .hi.purple[workers]

- Manufacturing Firms moved closer to low-wage suburbs

--




The _intercity_ truck (1930): alternative to ships and rail<sup>.pink[††]</sup>

.footnote[
.pink[†] Intra = Within 
.pink[††] Inter = Across
]

--

- .hi[Highways]: orientation .pink[shifted] from .purple[ports] and .purple[railroad terminals] to .pink[roads]

--

- .hi.orange[Modern cities]: manufacturers oriented toward highways and beltways $b_2 > b_1$


--
--

---






# Wrapping Up

So we had two models, the Von Thunen Model (rural bid rent) and the manufacturing bid rent

--

  - Both derived bid rent curves from .hi[zero economic profit]
  
  - Bid rent curves are different because .hi[costs] faced by .hi.purple[agriculture] and .hi.purple[manufacturing firms] are different
  
  - But the story and derivation behind them is pretty similar

--

__Remember__: Come to office hours if this feels hard. I am here to help!

Higher values of the wharton index $\implies$ tighter land use restrictions

# Example

# A Model

Do Land-Use regs and rent control interact? Absolutely! Let's model it

--

\begin{align*}
P(Q_d) &= 20 - 2*Q_d\\
P(Q_s) &= 8 + Q_s\\
\end{align*}

Compute the equilibrium. Graph it, if that is helpful

--

- Now suppose the government ratchets up land-use regs. New supply is given by:

\begin{align*}
P(Q_s^{new}) = 8 + 2*Q_s^{new}
\end{align*}

--


---

# Example

Old eq: $Q^* = 4$, $P^* = 12$

New eq: $Q^* = 3$, $P^* = 15$


Government comes in and says the rents are too high. Rent control set at $12$ per unit. Now you have:

\begin{align*}
12 = 8+2*Q_s \implies Q_s = 2
\end{align*}

- .hi.slate[Control]: Those living in small apartments complexes (5 or less) built after 1979 (not subject to rent control)

A fair comparison? Maybe concerned that those living in apartments built before or after 1979 are systematically different.

1) No invididual landlord can influence the price of rents

2) Landlords decide how much housing to provide

3) The amount of housing they provide will again come from profit maximization

__Important__: Labor market model: firm was deciding how much labor to hire. Now we will model the landlord as picking a quantity of housing to provide

# Wharton Index

&lt;img src="images/wharton_new.png" width="80%" height="80%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

Higher values of the wharton index `\(\implies\)` tighter land use restrictions

# Example

# A Model

Do Land-Use regs and rent control interact? Absolutely! Let's model it

--

`\begin{align*}
P(Q_d) &amp;= 20 - 2*Q_d\\
P(Q_s) &amp;= 8 + Q_s\\
\end{align*}`

Compute the equilibrium. Graph it, if that is helpful

--

- Now suppose the government ratchets up land-use regs. New supply is given by:

`\begin{align*}
P(Q_s^{new}) = 8 + 2*Q_s^{new}
\end{align*}`

--


---

# Example

Old eq: `\(Q^* = 4\)`, `\(P^* = 12\)`

New eq: `\(Q^* = 3\)`, `\(P^* = 15\)`


Government comes in and says the rents are too high. Rent control set at `\(12\)` per unit. Now you have:

`\begin{align*}
12 = 8+2*Q_s \implies Q_s = 2
\end{align*}`

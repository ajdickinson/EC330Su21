# A Question

__Important Policy Questions__: 

  - How do we reduce $CO_2$ per capita emissions in the US?
  
  - How do we keep per capita $CO_2$ emissions in China from exploding?
  
Future of global carbon emissions depends heavily on how car ownership rates evolve in China.

# So what?

Okay, congestion is an issue, how do we fix it?

--

.hi[Popular Answer:] Build more roads
  
  - Thought: if we build more roads, then congestion will decrease since there will be more space on the road

--

- .qa[Q]: What is the _crucial_ assumption we make when stating: "building roads will reduce congestion"

--

  - .qa[A]: The number of drivers will remain the same before and after the road is built

  - Inidividuals do not bear full cost of action, so they engage in it too often
  
  - Raise individual price until social cost = private cost $\implies$ people drive less 
  
  - Done via a tax (in this case: congestion)

# Discussion

Congestion taxes sound like a good idea, right? What are the problems? .hi.purple[Discuss]

--

- Roads aren't always congested. So tax needs to be time-varying. Gets very complicated

- Are all autos charged the same amount (semis and prius?)

__Important Policy Questions__: 

  - How do we reduce `\(CO_2\)` per capita emissions in the US?
  
  - How do we keep per capita `\(CO_2\)` emissions in China from exploding?
  
Future of global carbon emissions depends heavily on how car ownership rates evolve in China.

# So what?

Okay, congestion is an issue, how do we fix it?

--

.hi[Popular Answer:] Build more roads
  
  - Thought: if we build more roads, then congestion will decrease since there will be more space on the road

--

- .qa[Q]: What is the _crucial_ assumption we make when stating: "building roads will reduce congestion"

--

  - .qa[A]: The number of drivers will remain the same before and after the road is built

More people driving when a new road is built is easy to understand

3. Some people were _on the margin_ of driving, and the new road pushes them over

  - __Main insight__: social cost of driving exceeds private
  
  - Inidividuals do not bear full cost of action, so they engage in it too often
  
  - Raise individual price until social cost = private cost `\(\implies\)` people drive less 
  
  - Done via a tax (in this case: congestion)

# Discussion

Congestion taxes sound like a good idea, right? What are the problems? .hi.purple[Discuss]

--

- Roads aren't always congested. So tax needs to be time-varying. Gets very complicated

- Are all autos charged the same amount (semis and prius?)

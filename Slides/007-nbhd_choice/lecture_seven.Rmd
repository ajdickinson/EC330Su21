# Office Space

Last bid - rent curve we will work on: that for .hi[offices]

- We will take a break from math, I just want to get the intuition down

.hi.slate[Assumptions]

--

- Office firms use high skilled labor that need face to face interaction for production

--

- Proximity to other office firms is an important input

--

- Oppurtunity cost of high skilled labor time is greater than other types of labor

--

---

# Office Space

.hi.slate[Example]: Assume you have a bunch of identical firms

- They are located on a line. WTP for space depends on proximity to other firms




.pull-left[
```{R, office, out.width = "70%",out.height = "70%", echo = F}
include_graphics("images/office.png")
```
]


.pull-right[
- Travel dist in minimized at median location, block c

- Moving from med location puts firm closer to fewer others and further from more firms

- Firm D only has 15 total blocks of travel

]

---



# Office Bid Rent

- So as office firms get further from center their "transit" cost goes up. So what must happen to WTP? 


--

```{R, office_plot, echo=F,fig.height = 5, fig.width = 8, dev = "svg", cache=T}



office <- function(x)  20 / (1+x)

ggplot(data.frame(x=c(0, 20)), aes(x)) + 
  stat_function(fun= office, col = "purple")+
  geom_vline(xintercept = 0)+
  geom_hline(yintercept = 0)+
  labs(x = "distance to center", y = "Price (WTP)")+
  ggthemes::theme_pander()



```



--
---


# City Organization

So how do we put all of this together? And why are these called __bid__ rent curves anyways? 

--

- .hi[Land will be allocated to highest bidder]

- This will vary by location in the city

--

.hi.slate[Example]

- Assume profit for office and manufacturing is given by

--

- $\pi_{\text{office}} = 105 - r(x_{\text{Office}}) - (5 + 4*x_{\text{office}})$

- $\pi_{\text{manufact}}=  75 - r(x_{\text{manufact}}) - (5 + 2*x_{\text{manufact}})$

--

For consumers, they can allocate money between housing and commuting:

- $P =  \frac{100}{4} - \frac{2}{4}\cdot x$

---

# Example

.hi[Task]: 

-  Derive the bid rent curve for office space, manufacturing, and commuters. Plot all of them. 

--

- Find how land is allocated. Specifically, over what range from the center is office space, manufacturing space, and housing space?

--

---



# Example

.hi[Task]: 


Bid rent curves for office and manufacturing come from zero profit. Commuters curve was given.


- Office: $r(x_{\text{office}}) = 105 - (5+4*x_{\text{office}})$

- Manufact: $r(x_{\text{manufact}}) = 75 - (5+2*x_{\text{manufact}})$

- Commuters: (given) $P =  \frac{100}{4} - \frac{2}{4}\cdot x$


--

- Office firms locate in the range of $x$ in $[0,15]$

-  Manufacturing firms locate in the range of $x$ in $[15,30]$

- Commuters locate in the range of $x$ in $[30,50]$

--
---

# Example


```{R, city_plot, echo=F,fig.height = 5, fig.width = 8, dev = "svg", cache=T}

office2 <- function(x)  105 - (5+ 4*x)
manuf <- function(x)  75 - (5+ 2*x)
home <- function(x)  25 - .5*x

ggplot(data.frame(x=c(0, 65)), aes(x)) + 
  stat_function(fun= office2, col = "purple")+
  stat_function(fun= manuf, col = red_pink)+
  stat_function(fun= home, col = "#009A00")+
  geom_vline(xintercept = 0)+
  geom_hline(yintercept = 0)+
  labs(x = "distance to center", y = "Price (WTP)")+
  ggthemes::theme_pander()+
  ylim(-1,100)+
  geom_segment(x = 15, xend = 15, y=0, yend = 40, linetype = "dashed")+

  geom_text(x = 15, y= 0, label = "x_1 = 15", vjust = 2)+
  geom_text(x = 30, y= 0, label = "x_2 = 30", vjust = 2)

# Amenities

__Defn__ An _amenity_ is a .hi[location-specific] .pink[consumption good] 

- These can vary across cities, within cities

- Some shared by individuals, can be different for low and high income

More examples

--

- Beaches

- Parks

- Resteraunts

--

---


# Amenities

Let's refine our language a bit.  Two definitions:


1) .hi[Exogenous Amenities] are .hi[location-specific] consumption good that exist .pink[__are not__ influenced by where people decide to live] 

--

  - .pink[Exogenous] means "deteremined outside of the model." Think about .pink[exogenous] variables as given. 

--


--

2)  .hi.purple[Endogenous Amenities] are .hi[location-specific] consumption goods that .purple[__are__ influenced by location decisions of individuals]

--

  - .purple[Endogenous] means "deteremined within the model." The model here is that of individual location choices

--

--







---

# Examples

.hi[Exogenous Amenities]

  - Weather 

--

  - Proximity to Beaches and _federally_ protected natural areas (why not local?)
  
  - Proximity to Mountains
 
--
 
 
--

.hi.purple[Endogenous Amenities] 

  - School Quality and Quantity
  
  - Crime 

--

  - Air Quality (probably both)
  
  - Parks

--

--



To determine whether or not an amenity is .hi[exogenous] (.hi.purple[endogenous]), ask: "If I decide to live here, will this have an impact (even small) on the amenity of question?"

--

  - .hi[No: exogenous] _Beaches are there regardless of whether or not you live near the beach_
 
--

  - .hi.purple[Yes: endogenous] _Crime is a function of the individuals in the area_

# Amenities as Public Goods

Some amenities, like city parks, are _local public goods_. Does everyone care about these parks equally?



--

Probably not

--

.hi.slate[Example]: 

  - Consider a 3 citizen city each with differing demands (Max WTP) for parks
  
    - Saurabh has low demand, Sam has medium demand, Jenny has high demand

--

- Park Costs .hi[$60 per acre] to build

--

   - One way to fund: .hi.orange[share the burden] equally via a _per capita tax_ (each person pays 20 bucks p acre)

--

--



---


# Some Math

Let's be a bit more specific. Suppose the demand curves for each person are given by:



--

- $\text{Saurabh}:\color{#6A5ACD} {P = 50 -2*\text{acres}}$
 
- $\text{Sam}: \color{#e64173}{P = 40 -2*\text{acres}}$

- $\text{Jenny}: \color{#34b3ff}{P = 30 - 2*\text{acres}}$

--

--

.qa[Q]: Derive the number of acres of parks for each individuals with a $\color{#009A00}{20}$ dollar per person per acre tax

---

# Flat Tax

Tough decisions to make when deciding how much to build

--

- Any thoughts on how to allocate the resource? 

  - How much do we charge people?
  
  - How much do we build?
  
--

.hi[Discuss]

---


# Majority Rule and Median Voter

One way to make the collective choice of how many acres of parks to build: .hi.orange[majority rule]

  - Have a series of .hi[binary elections] (.pink[multiple votes, each vote there is only one option])
  
  - This election will always result in the winning option being the median voter (Sam)


--

What is the issue with this theory/model of park dev?

--

  - We see variation in size of parks built .hi.purple[IRL]
  
--

  - How do we rectify this?

--

---


# A twist

Now suppose there is a city with .hi[3 identical districts], each with 3 citizens (Saurabh, Sam, Jenny)'s

--

 - Each district votes on their own park
  
 - Each citizen knows the preferences for parks of other citizens

--



--

_Key Assumption_: .hi[Citizens pick which district to to live]. What is the implication?

--

--


- Similar types sort into the same neighborhood

--

- Ie, Saurabh and other low demand types recognize that if they move into the same district they have the highest chance of getting the level of parks they desire
  


---





# A twist

So, we have 3 neighborhoods with _homogenous types_. What does this do?

--

<center>
<font size="12"> Accomodate Diversity in Demand </font>
</center>

--

- In this perfect world, everybody gets what they want. Is reality this simple?

--

<center>
<font size="12"> Nope </font>
</center>

--


---



# Reality

## Real Cities

- Usually tax property - not a flax per capita tax

--

- Variation in property value also causes municipal formation (ie, .hi.orange[people sort on income], _.orange[not just preference for public goods]_)

--

--

## Real People

  - Care about a diverse set of things (not just parks). These usually don't overlap perfectly

--

  - Also: people do not know .hi[full set of preferences] of others

--

  - __Reality__: Not everyone gets what they want! `r emo::ji("frowning_face")`

# Neighborhood Sorting

I will motivate this with a .qa[question]:

--

  - Do you _fully_ internalize the costs and benefits of where you decide to live?
  
  - Put differently: Is your choice of neighborhood free from externalities?

--


.qa[Short Answer]: Nope. These externalities are different for adults and children


---


# Neighborhood Sorting


.hi[Externalities] for kids:

  - Good/bad role models as adults
  
  - Classmates in school: focused vs disruptive


--

.hi[Externalities] for adults:

  - Postive: job information, property valuation
  
  - Negative: property values 

--

In general: positive externalities increase with income and education level. Why?

---


# Neighborhood Sorting

These externalities give rise to the following questions:

1. Who gets desirable neighbors?

--

2. Will there be segregated or integrated neighborhoods?

--

3. Will there be sorting or mixing with respect to income, age, race, or some combination of those factors?

--

4. What are the implications for the price of land in various neighborhoods?

# Overview

So, public transit fixes a ton of external problems we are worried about, but raises a new set of questions:



1. How do we get people to use it?

2. When are Buses better than rail?

3. What population density is required to support public transit?

4. Can public transit ever be profitable?

# Examples

Everyone has probably experienced cities with public transit they like and dislike

# Transit to and from work in the US


```{R, transit1, out.width = "90%", out.height = "90%", echo = F}
include_graphics("images/transit_table.png")

# US Public Ridership over time

# Modeling Trip Cost

We can model trip costs as:

\begin{align*}
Cost = m + T_a\cdot d_a + T_v \cdot d_v
\end{align*}

where 

- m: monetary cost

--

- $T_a$: access time (getting to or waiting for transit)

- $d_a$: marginal disutility of access time

--

--

- $T_v$: Travel time 

- $d_v$: Marginal disutility of travel time

--

---

# Modeling Trip Cost

In general, $d_a > d_v$. What does this mean? .hi.purple[Discuss]

--

- Marginal disutility of waiting for a bus (or train) exceeds riding in one.

--

Can you use this model to explain why most people commute via car? (in the US)


--

- For cars, $T_a\cdot d_a$ is very small

- Aditionally, for many: $d_v^{car}> d_v^{transit}$, even when $T_v^{car} = T_v^{transit}$

--

Is $T_v^{car} = T_v^{transit}$? 

---

# Trains and Buses

Now let's discuss some costs and benefits to:

1. Buses

2. Trains

Can you think of any?

## Advantages 

- Integrated: commuters can make the entire trip on one vehicle without switching
- Time between Buses can be shorter

---



count: false

## Advantages

- Space between stops can be shorter

## Advantages 

- Integrated: commuters can make the entire trip on one vehicle without switching
- Time between Buses can be shorter
- Space between stops can be shorter
- _Relatively_ cheap to build and operate



## Disadvantages

  - Subject to same problems of congestion with automobiles 
  - Bunching (get off schedule with long stretches with no Buses, then many at once)


---



# Trains

## Advantages

- Seperate right of way: not sensitive to automobile congestion
- Can keep schedules relatively assiduously

- Can keep schedules relatively assiduously
- Easier to board for young, elderly, and disabled


## Disadvantages

- Not integrated: many riders must switch modes
- Widely spaced stations $\implies$ longer access time
- Sometimes (BART): very costly to ride!
- Super expensive to build (hundreds of millions per mile) and operate

---




# Cost Curves

Public transportation is subject to .hi[economies of scale]. Why?

--

- Indivisible inputs: cannot efficiently scale down building of trains

  - Is it more or less costly to operate 1 inch or 1 mile of train?
  
- __Mohring Economies__: More riders $\implies$ more buses/trains added to same route $\implies$ shorter wait times per rider
  
--

What does this imply for the shape of the average and marginal cost curves?

--

- They are decreasing

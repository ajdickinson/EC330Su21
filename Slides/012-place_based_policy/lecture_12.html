# Place-Based Policies

__Defn__: .hi[Place - Based Policies] Are policies that are location-specific .hi[specific areas]

- Can you think of some examples? .hi.purple[Discuss]

--

  - State and Local Taxes
  
  - State/City minimum wage
  
  - Zoning laws &amp; Land Use Restrictions
  
  - Enterprise Zones

--

---


# Place Based Policies

To be clear: .hi[federal policies] that are .pink[uniform across all states] _are not_ place-based policies

  - State policies are _place-based_

--

This can be confusing. 

--

  - In some sense, even federal income tax seems like a "place-based" policy, where the place is the whole US
  
  - Much hard(er) to .hi[migrate] across .pink[international borders], state borders are easy

--

  - Some people might have slightly different definitions of this. It can be a bit loose. 

--

--

--


---



# Enterpise Zones

__Defn__ .hi[Enterprise Zone]: 

&gt; A geographic area that has been granted .pink[tax breaks, regulatory exemptions, or other public assistance] in order to encourage private economic development and job creation

Examples:

  - Jersey City, NJ since 1983
  
  - China: Shanghai and Shenzen (Special Economic Zones (SEZ))
  
---


# Brownfield Remediation

- A _brownfield_ is previously developed land not currently in use due to industrial or commercial pollution



&lt;img src="images/us_brownfields.png" width="80%" height="80%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;


---


# Brownfield Remediation

- Property values around brownfields?
  
--

  - Lower

--

  - Cleaning these up raises .pink[amenity value] of the neighborhood

--

  - What happens to property values?
  
    - They go up! (this is gentrification)
--

---

# Air Quality Monitoring

_December 2, 1970_: Environmental Protection Agency  (EPA) is Established  

  - With it: The Clean Air Act
  
--

.hi[Following years]: amendments to the CAA (expanding scale and scope of EPA)

--

.col-left[

- 1990: Huge power granted to state and local authorities to enforce air quality standards

- 1997: PM 2.5 (particulate matter of 2.5 micrograms or less) standards placed

]

--

.col-right[

- 2005: PM2.5 standards enforced

-  2011: standards for greenhouse gases 

]

--

---

# Air Quality Monitoring

Particulate Matter (.hi.orange[PM]) in the US is regulated under the CAA at the .hi.green[county level]&lt;sup&gt;.pink[†]&lt;/sup&gt;

.footnote[
.pink[†] For more details, look [here](https://www.epa.gov/pm-pollution)
]

--

  - If a county exceeds certain threshold for .hi.orange[PM] , __all__ firms over a certain size need to pay a pretty big fine

  - Exceptions for fires, other natural events
  
- Not all counties are monitored


--

---

# Minimum Wage

Federal Minimum Wage: `\(7.25\)` (not a place based policy)



&lt;img src="images/min_wage.png" width="80%" height="80%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;



---






# Discussion

- Place-based policies can be tough to assess. Depends on the policy

  - Can target places, but people are mobile, and respond to changes in incentives

.hi.purple[Question]: Why do federal policies impact cities differently?

--

  - Min wage: might be binding in some states, others not
  
  - Federal Income Tax: Cost of Living varies by state.

# Up Next

- This next part you might find a little bit difficult

- My hope is to scratch the surface for how you might think of modeling the effects of a place-based policy

  - Need to set up a ton of stuff first 

--

- Some of these examples are based on [Mark Colas'](https://sites.google.com/site/markyaucolas/home?authuser=0) notes. He will teach you more about this in his 400 urban econ class

--

- I found some of this stuff inspiring - I hope you do too

---


# A Framework

We talked a little bit about .hi[utility] earlier in the term. What is it?

- An abstract notion of people's preferences. .hi.orange[Why do we care about this?]

--

- Want to think about policies and impact of policies

  - Need to think about what people care about to assess incidence/effectiveness of a particular policy

--

- Remember: .hi[higher levels of utility] are more desirable than low levels of utility


---



# A framework

.hi.slate[Example]: Could have preferences over left-shoes and right-shoes.  Utility might be:

`\begin{align*}
U(\text{left shoes},\text{right shoes}) = \min\left\{ \text{left shoes}, \text{right shoes}   \right\}
\end{align*}`

.qa[Q1]: In words, what does this say?

--

- I don't care about consuming more shoes unless I get more of both left and right shoes.

--

--

.qa[Q2] Give the above utility function, which bundle would I rather consume?

`\begin{align*}
\text{bundle 1}: (10000,1) \hspace{2in}
\text{bundle 2}: (2,2)
\end{align*}`

--

- `\(U(10000,1) = 1 &lt; U(2,2) = 2\)`, so I would rather consume bundle 2

---

# Utility

.hi[Main point]: Use it to rank outcomes. Remember: utility is .hi.purple[ordinal] _not_ .hi.purple[cardinal]

--

- This means: we cannot speak to ordering of outcomes, not level. 

  - Many utility functions give equivalent preference rankings

--

.qa[Q]: What if utility over shoes was: 

`\begin{align*}
U_2(\text{left shoes},\text{right shoes}) = 10*\min\left\{ \text{left shoes}, \text{right shoes}   \right\}
\end{align*}`

- Does this represent the same underlying preferences as the previous example (not multiplying by 10?)

--

  - Yes, because `\(U_2(10000,1) = 10*1 = 10 &lt; U_2(2,2)  = 10*2 = 20\)` 
  
    - So the bundle `\((2,2)\)` is still preferred to `\((10000,1)\)`

--

---


# Utility over Locations

Could we write a utility function over locations? Sure! What would go into this function?

--

  - What do people make location decisions on? 

--

- Let's start by assuming people only care about 3 features of locations:
  
  - .hi[wages], .hi.purple[rents], .hi.orange[amenites]

    - These all vary across locations, right? (first part of this class)


---

# Utility over Locations

- Let `\(w_j\)`, `\(r_j\)`, and `\(a_j\)` denote wages, rents, and amenities in location `\(j\)` 

  - `\(j = SF\)`, for example 

--

- .hi[General form]: `\(U(w_j, r_j,a_j) = U_j\)`

  - Says: utility in location `\(j\)` is a function of wages, rents, and amenities, in location `\(j\)`

--

--

- In practice, could write down an infinite number of functions for `\(U(\cdot)\)`. 

- .hi[Usual assumptions]: people like (higher utility) higher wages, lower rents, and better amenities. .hi.orange[Reasonable?]

--

---



# Example

.hi.slate[Example]: Let's go with a .hi[linear function] (and it's the same for everyone):

--

`\begin{align*}
U(w_j, r_j, a_j) = w_j - .5*r_j + a_j
\end{align*}`

--

- Suppose our two locations are SF and OAK again. If:

  -  `\(w_{SF} = 10, r_{SF} = 8, a_{SF} = 4\)`
  
  -  `\(w_{OAK} = 8, r_{OAK} = 3, a_{OAK} = 1\)`

--

.qa[Q] How do workers sort across the cities?

--

- `\(U(w_{SF}, r_{SF}, a_{SF}) = 10 - .5*8 + 4 = 10\)`

- `\(U(w_{OAK}, r_{OAK}, a_{OAK}) = 8 - .5*3 + 1 = 7.5\)`

--

- `\(10 &gt; 7.5\)` so everyone lives in SF

--

--

---

# What went wrong?

In that model, everyone lived in SF and nobody lived in Oakland. .pink[Problems]?

--

- Not everybody has the same preferences (utility functions)

- Was that last example an example in .hi[locational equilibrium]?

--

--

- No! In .pink[locational equilibrium], utility is .purple[equalized across locations]. Can't have:

  - `\(U(w_{SF}, r_{SF}, a_{SF}) &gt; U(w_{OAK}, r_{OAK}, a_{OAK})\)`

--

---


# Equilibrium


- Again: in equilibrium, .purple[utility is equal across locations]. 


- .pink[All values] from last example were made up, but .pink[amenity values] were __extra made up__. Why?

--

- We don't observe them! We see .pink[wages] and .pink[rents] in data, but amenities are more abstact.

--

  - Can be composed of a ton of different things
  
--

--


- How can we locational eq to "fix up" our last example?


---

# Calculating Amenities

- Ok, now suppose we have the same wages and rents: 

  -  `\(w_{SF} = 10, r_{SF} = 8\)`
  
  - `\(w_{OAK} = 8, r_{OAK} = 3\)`
  
--

- .hi[Twist] _We do not know amenities in each city_

--

- Furthermore, suppose we enforce that .pink[utility is equal in all locations], which is some number `\(k\)`

--

- How can we solve for amenities in each city?

--

`\begin{align*}
U(w_{j}, r_{j}, a_{j}) = w_j - .5*r_j + a_j = k \implies a_{j} = k + .5*r_j - w_j 
\end{align*}`

--

- So `\(a_{SF} = k + .5*8 - 10\)` and `\(a_{OAK} = k + .5*3 - 8\)`

  - and thus `\(a_{SF} &gt; a_{OAK}\)`

--

---

# Backing Up


`\begin{align*}
a_{j} = k + .5*r_j - w_j 
\end{align*}`


.qa[Q] What does this equation tell us? 

--

- In equilibrium, .hi[higher rents] `\(\implies\)` .pink[higher amenity value]

- In equilibrium, .hi.purple[higher wages] `\(\implies\)` .purple[lower amenity value]

--

- __Note__: 

  - Our calculation for `\(a_j\)` rested heavily on our assumption for the utility function
  
  - .qa[Q]: Did the ordering of the `\(a_j\)`'s rest on the assumption? 

---


# Another Problem

- Okay, so people move and utility is equal across all locations

- Thus far, we have assumed .hi.purple[wages] and .hi[rents] do not respond to these choices

--

  - First 6 weeks of this class should tell you: this is a .hi.orange[bad assumption]

--

--

- Let's let rents, but not wages, adjust to individual location decisions

  - _Rents are endogenous_

--


---

# Rents


- Rents in every city given by:

--

`\begin{align*}
r_j(L_j) = 2*L_j
\end{align*}`

--

- `\(r_j(L_j)\)`: rents _are a function_ of the population (not multiplied)

- `\(L_j\)` is the pop in city `\(j\)` -- the 2 was arbitrary

---

# Example

- Suppose we have two cities `\(1\)` and `\(2\)`, with 7 people total. That is: `\(L_1 + L_2 = 7\)`

--

- Utility: `\(U(w_{j}, r_{j}(L_j), a_{j}) = w_j - .5*r_j(L_j) + a_j\)`

- Wages: `\(w_1 = 12\)`, `\(w_2 = 7\)`, __rents__ : `\(r_j(L_j) = 2*L_j\)`

--

- Amenities: `\(a_1 = a_2 = 0\)` (to make it easy)


--

- .qa[Question]: How many people live in each city, and what are rents in each city? __Note__: You have .hi[two equations] 

--

--
  
  - `\(U(w_{1}, r_{1}(L_1), a_{1}) = U(w_{2}, r_{2}(L_1), a_{2})\)` (from locational eq) 
    
  - `\(L_1 + L_2 = 7\)` you know the total population
    
--
... and .hi[two unknowns] (namely, `\(L_1\)` and `\(L_2\)`)
--
    
--

---

# Example

Locational eq gives:

`\begin{align*}
w_1 - .5*r_1(L_1) &amp;= w_2 - .5*r_1(L_2)\\
12 - .5*(2*L_1) &amp;= 7 - .5*(2*L_2)\\
-L_1 &amp;= -5 - L_2\\
L_1 &amp;= 5 + L_2
\end{align*}`

--

Population must sum to 7. Thus:

`\begin{align*}
L_1 + L_2 &amp;= 7\\
5+ L_2 + L_2 &amp;= 7\\
2*L_2 &amp;= 2\\
L_2 = 2 \implies L_1 = 5
\end{align*}`
--
---


# Back to Place-Based Policies

Ok, how do we tie this back into .hi[place-based] policies?

.hi.slate[Example]

--

- Initial equilibrium: `\(U(w_{j}, r_{j}(L_j),a_{j}) = k\)` for all cities `\(j\)`

--

- Let's suppose `\(SF\)` implements a 30%, flat, income tax

  - Post-tax wage in city `\(SF\)` is now `\(w^{tax}_{SF} = 0.7*w_{SF}\)` 
  
  - Assume __wages are fixed__, but __rents adjust to population__

--

--

- Utility in city `\(j\)` is: 

`\begin{align*}
U(w^{tax}_{SF}, r_{SF}(L_{SF}),a_{SF}) &lt; U(w_{SF}, r_{SF}(L_{SF}),a_{SF})
\end{align*}`

--

- If utility is .hi[increasing in wages] (more money `\(\implies\)` more utility), then an income-tax .pink[lowers utility].

---

# In Equilibrium

Ok so, can it be an equilibrium if: 

`\begin{align*}
U(w^{tax}_{SF}, r_{SF}(L_{SF}),a_{SF}) &lt; U(w_{SF}, r_{SF}(L_{SF}),a_{SF})
\end{align*}`

--

- No! because `\(U(w_{SF}, r_{SF}(L_{SF}),a_{SF}) = k\)`

  - So `\(U(w^{tax}_{SF}, r_{SF}(L_{SF}),a_{SF}) \neq k\)`

--

- People move .pink[away from SF] (and rents fall). So utility goes up in SF 

- It continues to go up until `\(U(w^{tax}_{SF}, r_{SF}(L_{SF}),a_{SF}) = k\)`



---

# Extensions

- This flexible way of modeling gives us many options for modeling place based policies

--

- Other kind of subsidies/taxes: goes into `\(w_j\)`

- Rent subsidies or property taxes: impacts `\(r_j\)`

--

- .qa[Q]: How would you model an increase in public school quality?

---


# Extensions

- A lot of thought goes into figuring what the coefficients on the utility function should be. That is:

  - `\(U(w_{j}, r_{j}(L_j), a_{j}) = w_j - .5*r_j(L_j) + a_j\)`

- Why a .5 attached to rents? Is this important?

--

  - Yes it is important. A higher value attached to rents `\(\implies\)` people are more responsive with their location choice with respect to changes in rents

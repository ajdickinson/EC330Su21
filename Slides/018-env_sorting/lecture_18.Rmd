# Intro

Household emit carbon for many reasons. 

1) Use of appliances. Main Culprits:

  - Air conditioning (electricity)
  
  - Heating (natural gas)
  
2) Driving

We will focus on 1). The amount of electricity and natural gas a household consumes varies considerably across cities

# Carbon Emissions

Utilization of energy (natural gas, electricity) leads to carbon emissions

  - Natural gas directly emits carbon (so the emissions factor is independent of location)
  
  - Electricity needs to be produced at a power plant.

# Land-Use Restrictions

Cities also vary in the amount of land use restrictions they have. In some cities, land use restrictions are tight, meaning lots of costs and restrictions from building more housing.

  - Measured by the [Wharton Land Use Regulation Index](http://realestate.wharton.upenn.edu/working-papers/a-new-measure-of-the-local-regulatory-environment-for-housing-markets-the-wharton-residential-land-use-regulatory-index/)

# Example

Suppose $k_1 = 2$, $k_2 =  4$. Also suppose $P^{elec}_1 = 10$ and $P^{elec}_2 = 10$.

# Example

Furthermore, let $e^*_j$ be the households optimal consumption of electicity in location $j$. This is given by:

e^*_j = \frac{\frac{1}{10}*w_j}{P^{elec}_j}

Emis_j = \delta_j* e^*_j*L^*_j

__Carbon Emissions__:

  - .hi[CA]: low marginal benefit of energy use (temperate climate)
  - Carbon efficient power plants 
  - Thus, should expect equilibrium emissions to fall as a result
